# Exporting & Formats

How to get a finished file out of a tool — picking the right format, setting the output size, and what each option does. Like everything else, **export happens on your device**; nothing is uploaded.

## How export works

The preview *is* the file. When you export, the host renders that canvas to the format you chose and hands you a download (or puts it on your clipboard). A tool only offers the formats its author declared, and the picker hides any your browser can't produce (see [Video](#video)).

Three paths produce a file. Most tools **render the canvas** to the chosen format. Text and data formats (HTML, MD, TXT, JSON, CSV, ICS, VCF) are instead **generated from the tool's content**, not rasterised from the picture. And privacy utilities (e.g. *Strip Hidden Data*) use a third path: the file *you* pick is transformed byte-for-byte on device and handed straight back — no canvas, no watermark, and no provenance metadata added, because it's already your own file.

The actions in the export controls:

- **Download** — save the file (the primary action).
- **Copy** — put the image on your clipboard to paste straight into Slack, email, a doc. Where a browser can't copy images, it downloads instead and tells you.
- **Save** — keep the current design as a saved tool session in your library.
- **Share** — opens the **Share dialog**: a copyable link that reproduces the design, on-visit toggles (fullscreen, export panel, download- or copy-on-open), and an optional **Shortest link** that packs the whole state into a compact token (see [URL Mode](/info/url-mode.html)).

(A tool's author picks which of these appear; the default set is Copy, Download, and Save.)

### Rendering many at once

A single export is one file, but you can render **many** in one pass — each delivered as one `.zip`:

- **Projects → Render folder** exports every saved session in a folder (and its sub-folders) as one nested zip; **Render selection** does the same for any multi-selection; a single saved session renders straight to its own file. No Batch/Pro needed — see [Using Lolly → Projects](/info/using.html).
- **Batch (Pro)** renders a grid of input sets — every variant of one template at once.

A saved session can also be re-shared as a tool link from Projects (it reconstructs the tool URL from the saved inputs), so a link reopens it with the exact same settings.

## Choosing a format

| You want… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Crisp logos / artwork that scales | **SVG** | Vector — infinitely scalable, tiny, editable |
| Vector for Office / Windows apps | **EMF** | Pastes as editable vector into PowerPoint / Word |
| Vector for print / design apps | **EPS**, or **EPS (CMYK)** | PostScript vector for Illustrator / press workflows |
| A photo or general-purpose image | **PNG** (lossless) or **JPG** (smaller) | Universal raster |
| Smaller modern images | **WebP** / **AVIF** | Better compression, alpha |
| Print | **PDF**, or **Print PDF** (CMYK) | True page size; CMYK for press |
| Print raster for a press | **Print TIFF** (CMYK) | DeviceCMYK pixels for a RIP |
| Animated for the web | **GIF** | Works everywhere, larger files |
| Animated with full colour + real alpha | **APNG** | Animated PNG — no palette limit, true transparency |
| Video for social / sharing | **MP4** or **WebM** | Best quality-per-byte (see below) |
| Rich text / email signature | **HTML** | Pastes formatted into mail clients |
| Plain content | **MD** / **TXT** | Text only |
| A calendar event | **ICS** | Imports into any calendar app |
| A contact card | **VCF** | Imports into Contacts / address books |
| Structured data to re-import | **JSON** / **CSV** | Round-trips the tool's content |
| A favicon | **ICO** | Multi-size site icon (**ZIP** bundles several formats) |

## Size & print units

By default exports use the tool's native pixel size. Where a tool exposes **dimensions**, you can set width × height and a **unit**:

- **px** (default) — exact pixels.
- **mm · cm · in · pt · pc** — physical/print sizes. With a physical unit you also set **DPI** (default **300** for print); the engine converts correctly per format — **PDF** becomes a true page at that size, **raster** renders at the right pixel count for the DPI (and embeds the resolution), **SVG** keeps the physical unit with a px viewBox.

To get a higher-resolution raster, enter a larger width/height, or choose a physical unit and raise the DPI (pixels = size × DPI). There's no one-click scale toggle.

Example: width `210`, height `297`, unit `mm` → an A4 page.

## Multi-page PDF

Some tools build a **multi-page PDF document** instead of a single artwork — a cover, content that flows onto as many pages as it needs, and a back page, all in one file (see the *Multi-Page PDF* tool). Each page is a **true PDF page** sized to that page's box, so readers and printers get real pages, not one tall image.

- **Pages from content.** Add blocks of text and images; new pages are created automatically as the blocks fill, and you can force any block to start a new page.
- **Real page sizes.** Choose A4, US Letter or A5, portrait or landscape — every page, and the exported PDF, renders at exactly that size.

Multi-page PDFs are RGB documents and don't carry crop/bleed marks — those belong to the single-page **Print PDF** path above. They do carry the same **PDF/X-4 metadata** as every PDF export (page boxes, XMP, document ID, an sRGB output intent with embedded profile), and they offer **Content Credentials** (below) — on the *Multi-Page PDF* tool the option comes pre-selected.

## Transparency

Tools that support it offer a **transparent background** toggle (e.g. *No BG*). Transparency is preserved by PNG, WebP, AVIF, and SVG. JPG and PDF are always opaque.

## Colour profiles

So colours reproduce faithfully in colour-managed apps (print shops, Photoshop, browsers), exports are **tagged with a colour profile**:

- **PNG / JPG** carry an embedded **sRGB** ICC profile — the colour space the preview is actually rendered in — so nothing is left to guess. (Tagging only; the pixels aren't re-encoded.)
- **Print PDF (CMYK)** declares a target **press condition** in its *OutputIntent* (default *Coated FOGRA39*), telling a RIP/print shop how its CMYK inks are meant to be read. Brand swatches with measured ink values are converted exactly; other colours use a standard device conversion.
- **Print TIFF (CMYK)** writes untagged **DeviceCMYK** pixels and records the same press condition as provenance in its TIFF metadata (*ImageDescription*) rather than embedding a profile. The same Colour-profile control drives both CMYK formats.
- **TIFF (RGB)** is the plain, uncompressed sRGB sibling — a lossless raster at the chosen DPI for archival or an editor round-trip, with provenance recorded in the same TIFF metadata. Any transparency is flattened onto white (this profile carries no alpha). Like the CMYK TIFF it's desktop-only, since browsers can't preview a TIFF and mobile downloads dead-end.
- **SVG**, **EMF** and **EPS** are resolution- and profile-independent vectors with no embedded profile — SVG's colours are plain sRGB, EMF's and EPS's are device RGB (and **EPS (CMYK)** writes naive DeviceCMYK). (All, like PDF, outline any text to vector paths, so the result renders even where the font isn't installed.) **SVG** also reproduces CSS `box-shadow` from the HTML — each outer shadow is painted behind the box, offset/spread and Gaussian-blurred to match the browser (inset shadows are skipped).

This is automatic — no setting to fiddle with. Thumbnails and previews skip the tag to stay small.

## Video

Animated tools export motion as **MP4**, **WebM**, or **GIF**. Which video container you see depends on your browser — the picker only shows what it can actually record:

| Browser | Shows |
|---|---|
| Safari / iOS | **MP4** |
| Firefox | **WebM** |
| Chrome / Edge 126+ / Android | **MP4 and WebM** |
| Older Chrome | **WebM** |

GIF works everywhere (great for chat/email; larger and lower-colour than video). Animated tools also expose **Wait** (seconds to let the animation settle before recording) and **Duration** (clip length).

> A shared `?format=…` link that requests a container your browser can't record gracefully falls back to the other and names the file accordingly.

## Provenance & watermark

Where the format supports it, exports carry **provenance metadata** — software, source, the tool's name, and your profile credit line — embedded natively (PNG iTXt, JPEG EXIF, PDF info, SVG `<metadata>`, GIF comment). It's authorship only; nothing is uploaded. **Experimental** tools additionally stamp a visible watermark, applied by the host so it can't be removed by editing the tool.

**Composed renders.** When a tool embeds another tool's output (e.g. an *Event Name Badge* embedding a *QR Code*), the nested render is inlined into the parent's export — it stays a **true vector** in SVG and PDF and rasterises crisply in PNG/JPG/WebP. The embedded child is an intermediate: it gets *no* watermark and *no* provenance of its own; only the finished parent asset does. (Composition covers SVG and the raster formats; HTML/MD/TXT can't be composed.)

## Password protection

Two independent kinds of lock, both entirely on-device.

**PDF open-password** — the export panel's *Password protect* card offers two tiers:

- **Standard** — a basic 40-bit lock (RC4). It opens in *any* PDF app, and — being a light deterrent, not real protection — it can travel in a share link (clear-text, by design). RGB `pdf` only.
- **Strong** — AES-256 (PDF 2.0). Its password is typed at export and is **never** put in a link; it opens only in newer PDF apps (Acrobat / Preview ~2018 on), and older apps may report the file as damaged. Strong also applies to **Print / CMYK PDFs** and to **each PDF inside a batch zip** (the batch confirm dialog collects the password). Because PDF/X-4 forbids encryption, a Strong-locked Print PDF keeps its CMYK, marks and output-intent but drops the PDF/X-4 conformance claim.

Either tier is mutually exclusive with Content Credentials (an encrypted PDF can't take the credential).

**Locked downloads (whole-zip + defense-in-depth)** — a **folder** or **multi-file** download (Projects → Download, or the batch grid) can lock the entire zip with one password, at two tiers:

- **Standard** — traditional **ZipCrypto**: opens in *any* unzip tool including Windows Explorer's built-in extract, but weak (a deterrent).
- **Strong** — **AES-256** (WinZip AE-2): strong, but does **not** open in Windows Explorer's built-in extract — the recipient needs 7-Zip / WinZip / Keka / macOS.

The one password protects **every** member — images, SVG, everything, not just PDFs (only the zip container can protect non-PDF files, which have no lock of their own). And it's **defense-in-depth**: any PDF inside is *also* individually AES-256-locked with the same password, so a PDF stays locked even after the zip is unpacked. The prompt appears when you start the download; a blank password means no lock.

**Password-gated share links** — any share link can be encrypted so that opening it asks the recipient for a password. The whole link state is AES-256-encrypted under a key derived from the password (PBKDF2); only ciphertext travels, so the **password is never in the link**, and decryption happens **in the recipient's browser — nothing is sent to a server**. Turn it on in the **Share** dialog. An encrypted link can only be *opened* in Lolly (it can't be embedded as an image, since that path can't prompt). See [URL Mode → Encrypted links](/info/url-mode.html).

## Content Credentials (C2PA)

Exports can carry **Content Credentials** — a signed [C2PA](https://c2pa.org) manifest embedded in the file that records, in a tamper-evident way, that the file was made with Lolly and hasn't been altered since. It's the standards-track version of the provenance metadata above: a cryptographic claim (what made the file, when, by whom, and where) bound to a hash of the file's bytes, so any later edit is detectable by a C2PA-aware viewer. The standard is stewarded by the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org) (Adobe, BBC, Microsoft, Nikon and others), so the same credentials Lolly writes are the ones cameras, newsrooms and creative suites are adopting.

- **Formats.** Every container with a C2PA embedding: **PDF** (both RGB and Print), **PNG / Animated PNG**, **JPG**, **GIF**, **SVG**, **TIFF** (RGB and Print), **WebP**, **MP4** and **WebM**. A **ZIP** bundle stamps each supported member individually. MP4 uses the spec's BMFF binding, so `c2patool` and other C2PA-aware viewers verify it; WebM has no standardised C2PA mapping yet, so Lolly carries the manifest as a Matroska attachment that Lolly's own verifier (and CLI) checks. (`avif` is not yet supported; `ico`, `eps`, `emf` and the text/data formats have no C2PA container.)
- **Turning it on.** Tick the **Content Credentials** card in the export panel. The *Multi-Page PDF* tool pre-selects it; it's optional everywhere else.
- **What it records.** The tool and app that made the file, the signing time, the export surface (browser engine family + OS family — coarse on purpose, never a fingerprint), and — only when *Profile → Use my details* is on — your name and email as the work's author.
- **What recipients see.** Inspect-content-credentials tools (Adobe apps, `c2patool`, contentcredentials.org/verify) will read the manifest and show the claim. Because Lolly signs with a key generated **on your device** — not a certificate from a trust list — viewers report it as an *unverified* credential. The structure and the tamper-evidence are real; the signer identity is simply not vouched for by an authority. To upgrade that, you can enrol a **verified identity** (Profile → Content Credentials): a short-lived certificate from the Lolly CA ties your email to your exports while the signing key still never leaves your device — see [Content Credentials Identity](/info/content-credentials-identity.html).
- **Checking a file.** Lolly verifies its own credentials too: drop any file on [/valid](/valid) (or run `brand-tool validate <file>` in the CLI) for an on-device report — headlined by whether the file was genuinely made with Lolly and unchanged since.
- **Privacy.** Everything happens on your device: the signing key is created for the export and never leaves the browser, nothing is uploaded, and the claim contains only what the provenance metadata already carries. Privacy utilities (on-device transforms of *your own* files) never add credentials, and *Strip Hidden Data* will remove a C2PA manifest like any other embedded metadata.
- **Interactions.** For PDFs, Content Credentials and **password protection** (either tier — see above) are mutually exclusive (an encrypted PDF can't take the credential attachment). The credential is added as the final step over the finished bytes — after DPI/EXIF/colour-profile stamping, PDF/X metadata, and print marks.

## On a phone

The export controls live behind the floating **Render** button, which opens the **Export** sheet — same formats, size, copy, download, and share, sized for touch.

# Design Tokens

Design tokens are Lolly's **single source of truth for brand primitives** - colours first, then dimensions, type, and the rest. One canonical token document feeds three things at once: the values baked into tools, the swatches the colour picker offers, and an import/export bridge to other design tools. The format is the [W3C Design Tokens (DTCG)](https://www.designtokens.org/TR/drafts/format/) standard - the same format [Penpot imports and exports](https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/design-systems/design-tokens/) - so a brand defined in Lolly round-trips with Penpot and Tokens Studio. (Tokens carry the brand *variables* both ways; finished Figma/Penpot *files* come in through Layout Studio's [Import a design](/info/design-import.html).)

This page is the spec. The engine model is [`engine/src/tokens.ts`](../engine/src/tokens.ts); the format contract is pinned by [`tests/tokens.test.ts`](../tests/tokens.test.ts).

> **Status.** The **colour** slice is shipped: brand colours are canonical tokens, the picker's swatches come from them, and a chosen brand colour stays *linked* to its token. **Dimension tokens** (radius, spacing, sizing, stroke, opacity, rotation, shadows) and **typography** (brand fonts) are shipped too, editable in the [Brand Studio](/info/brand-studio.html)'s Tokens and Type tabs. **User import/export** is shipped - import W3C DTCG / Tokens Studio / Penpot in the Studio (or via [`ingest:brand`](/info/configuration.html#brand-packs)), and export a `LollyBrand` pack or a design-tokens palette. Token-aware tool *injection into templates* remains on the [roadmap](/info/overview.html#roadmap).

## Why tokens

Before tokens there were three disagreeing colour "truths": a hard-coded swatch array in the web shell, a `palette` catalog asset that tools could reference, and the engine's colour-management maths. Tokens collapse the first two into one canonical, versioned, git-reviewed source - and make it portable. The goal the project states plainly: *keep as many things as possible canonical via tokens, and be able to import/export them with tools like Penpot.*

## The format (a DTCG profile)

A token document is DTCG JSON. A **token** is an object with `$value` (required) and `$type`; **groups** are objects without `$value` and pass their `$type` down to descendants. References between tokens use the curly-brace alias `{dotted.path}`.

```json
{
  "color": {
    "$type": "color",
    "brand": {
      "jungle": {
        "$value": "#30ba78",
        "$description": "Jungle",
        "$extensions": { "com.suse.lolly": { "cmyk": [70, 0, 65, 0] } }
      }
    },
    "semantic": {
      "primary": { "$value": "{color.brand.jungle}" }
    }
  }
}
```

Two deliberate choices keep us interoperable with Penpot while serving Lolly's print needs:

- **Colours: read every form, store perceptually, resolve to hex.** DTCG's newer colour *object* (`{colorSpace, components, alpha, hex}`) is parsed, and so is every CSS Color 4 string - `#hex`, `rgb()/rgba()`, `hsl()/hsla()`, `hwb()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, `oklch()` and `color(<space> …)` across 14 colour spaces (`engine/src/css-color.ts`), which covers everything Penpot emits and a good deal more. A value *resolves* to a hex string (`#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa` / `transparent`) for rendering, except a bare colour keyword, which is handed back as-is. What Lolly **stores** is a different question: a derived brand writes `oklch()` into `$value`, and a swatch's *Stored as* control can pin `lch` (the default), hex, `rgb()` or `hsl()` instead. All of those are forms Penpot ingests cleanly.
- **CMYK rides in `$extensions`.** Print anchors live under the vendor key `com.suse.lolly`. DTCG reserves `$extensions` for exactly this, and Penpot round-trips it untouched - so a colour stays print-correct without breaking compatibility.

**Sets and themes.** Top-level keys can be token *sets*; a `$themes` array selects and orders sets per theme (later sets override earlier - Tokens-Studio layering), with `$metadata.tokenSetOrder` fixing the order. A document with no `$themes` is one implicit set, and token paths keep their `color.brand.x` shape.

## The four layers

**1. Engine - [`engine/src/tokens.ts`](../engine/src/tokens.ts).** Platform-agnostic, like `units.ts`. `createTokenSet(doc, { theme })` parses a document, inherits group `$type`, resolves `{}` aliases (chains, cycle-safe), applies the theme, and returns a flat lookup with `get` / `resolve` / `query({type})` / `colors()` / `themes()`. It knows DTCG and nothing else - no DOM, no storage, no SUSE - so it ships as part of the open-source engine.

**2. Catalog - a `tokens` asset.** Each brand pack ships one core-tier `tokens` asset and the active profile decides which is canonical - `suse/tokens/brand` in the SUSE pack, `lolly/tokens/brand` in the blank brand, `<brand>/tokens/brand` for a pack built by `ingest:brand` (a `tokens`-type catalog asset, `core` tier so it's always available offline). It is generated from the shell palette by [`scripts/build-brand-tokens.ts`](../scripts/build-brand-tokens.ts) and validated against [`schemas/tokens.schema.json`](../schemas/tokens.schema.json) by `npm run validate:catalog`. Versioned and checksummed like any asset.

**3. User tokens - *shipped*.** A device-local store for the tokens a user creates or imports (from Penpot, DTCG, or a `LollyBrand` pack), travelling as the `tokens.json` part of a `LollyBrand` pack, and inside the full data backup as a user asset in `assets.json` (see [Data Transfer](/info/data-transfer.html)). The [Brand Studio](/info/brand-studio.html) handles import, editing, the active theme, and export back to DTCG.

**4. Bridge - `host.tokens`.** An additive, optional v1 capability (like `net`/`text`): `get` / `colors` / `resolve` / `themes`. Each shell implements it over the engine model and its sources; a shell that doesn't is simply not token-driven. Loading is offline-safe (prefers the core-prefetched blob, falls back to a direct fetch, then to the built-in palette).

## How tools consume tokens

**Platform hydration (the common case).** Most tools never mention tokens. The platform feeds them:

- **The picker's swatches are tokens.** The colour field sources its swatches from `host.tokens.colors()` for the active theme, labelled and grouped by token. This is what the `palette` input field always promised.
- **Brand-bound values stay linked.** Choosing a token swatch stores a *reference*, not a frozen hex (see below), so a later token edit propagates everywhere.

**Direct injection - *(planned)*.** A token-aware tool (a brand sheet, a style guide, a chart that maps series to brand colours) can receive the resolved token tree in its template context via the existing `extras` mechanism, opted into from the manifest.

## The value model: reference + cached value

When a user picks a token-backed colour, the stored value is **a reference plus the hex it last resolved to**:

```json
{ "ref": "{color.brand.jungle}", "value": "#30ba78" }
```

A token-backed swatch reads as its token in the sidebar: the trigger carries the swatch's *name*, not a frozen hex, which is the visible difference between a linked value and one typed in by hand.

![A tool's colour row holding a token-backed value, the trigger showing the swatch circle and its name instead of a hex code](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Ftool%2Fwordmark%3Ftext%3DLinked%26color%3D%257Bcolor.spectrum.rose%257D&width=1440&height=900&dpi=192&waitMs=2000&css=%23tool-canvas%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&format=svg&cropSelector=.input-row%3Ahas%28%5Bdata-color-field%3D%22color%22%5D%29&walker=1&filename=at2-token-linked-swatch)

The `ref` keeps the value canonical - editing the token, or switching themes, re-resolves it everywhere. The cached `value` is the graceful fallback for a device where that token is absent. The path is fully backward-compatible: a plain colour string (a custom pick, or any existing tool) flows through untouched.

How it moves through the engine:

- **Hydration** ([`runtime.ts`](../engine/src/runtime.ts) → `resolveTokenRefs`, mirroring asset-ref resolution): on load, each token-backed colour re-resolves against the live token set and its cached hex is refreshed. `modelToValues` then hands the template a plain hex string - templates and data/JSON exports never see an object.
- **Hooks** see the flattened hex too (`modelForHooks` in [`inputs.ts`](../engine/src/inputs.ts)): the `{ ref, value }` shape is an engine detail and never reaches a tool's `onInit`/`onInput`, so the common `(inputs.x || '').trim()` pattern keeps working.
- **URL mode** ([`url-mode.ts`](../engine/src/url-mode.ts)): a token colour serialises to its reference (`?bg={color.brand.jungle}`), so a shared link re-resolves against the *recipient's* tokens. Parsing a `{path}` yields an unresolved token value the runtime then resolves.

- **Editing past a token** (typing a hex, dragging alpha) emits a plain string - deliberately de-linking from the token, because the user just overrode it.

Nothing in the link below names a colour. Its three colour params are token paths (`{color.spectrum.violet}`, `{color.spectrum.teal}`, `{color.spectrum.amber}`), resolved at render time against whatever brand the device is carrying.

## Penpot interop

- **Author/generate:** the brand tokens are a DTCG document - already the shape Penpot reads.
- **Import/export (shipped):** import a Penpot single-file, ZIP, or multifile export (`$themes.json` + `$metadata.json` + one file per set) in the [Brand Studio](/info/brand-studio.html) or via [`ingest:brand`](/info/configuration.html#brand-packs), and export Lolly's tokens back as DTCG. CMYK survives Lolly→Lolly round-trips via `$extensions` and is ignored by Penpot, as the standard intends.

## Migration & status

The brand colours moved into tokens without changing what anyone sees: `scripts/build-brand-tokens.ts` derives the token document from the existing palette, so the picker shows the same colours - now sourced canonically. The shell palette remains the fallback (and, for now, the source of CMYK anchors on export). With dimension/typography tokens and user import/export now shipped, most of the app resolves from tokens and the standalone palette recedes; template-level token *injection* is the main piece still to land.

The corner radius is the plainest of the shipped dimension tokens: one slider writing one `shape.radius` value that the app chrome, the panels and every opted-in tool then follow.

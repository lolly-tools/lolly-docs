# Configuration guide

Everything that shapes *what a Lolly instance is* - which brand it wears, which tools it exposes, what each tool is allowed to do - is configuration held in files, not settings buried in an app. This guide is the map of those files and the commands that act on them.

## Profiles: brand + tool set

A **profile** binds a set of tool packs to a brand catalog. `profiles.json` at the repo root declares them:

```json
{
  "default": "suse",
  "profiles": {
    "suse":        { "label": "SUSE",  "tools": ["community", "brands/suse/tools"], "catalog": "brands/suse/catalog" },
    "lolly-start": { "label": "Lolly Start (blank brand)", "tools": ["community", "brands/lolly-start/tools"], "catalog": "brands/lolly-start/catalog" }
  }
}
```

The repo-root `tools/` and `catalog/` are **gitignored views** of the active profile - never edit or commit them directly. Switch profiles with:

```bash
npm run profile            # show the active profile + what's available
npm run profile:suse       # community + SUSE tools, SUSE catalog
npm run profile:start      # blank brand: community tools + one neutral tokens asset
```

`scripts/use-profile.ts` builds the views: `catalog` becomes a symlink to the brand's catalog, and `tools/` becomes a directory of per-tool symlinks merged from the profile's tool roots - **later roots win on id collisions**, so a brand pack can override a community tool of the same id. In a hosted or serverless build, pass `--copy` to materialise the views as real copies instead of symlinks (symlinks don't survive a function bundle). Writes through the views land in the real pack checkouts, so the normal edit → commit workflow is unchanged.

## Brand packs

A brand pack is a directory (`brands/<name>/`) with a `catalog/` and optionally its own `tools/`. A pack can live in the parent repo (as `brands/lolly-start/` does) or be mounted from its own repository as a git submodule - which is how a private pack such as `brands/suse` stays out of public clones, so an instance without access to it simply falls back to `lolly-start`. See [Build Guide » Getting the source](/info/build-guide.html) for checking one out.

Stand a new pack up from a design-tokens export:

```bash
npm run ingest:brand -- <source> --name <brand> [--label "Label"] [--register|--activate]
```

`<source>` is any container Penpot / Tokens Studio export the same DTCG document in - a monolithic `tokens.json`, a one-file-per-set directory, or a `project.penpot` archive. The extracted document lands at `catalog/assets/<ns>/tokens/brand.json` as the pack's core-tier `tokens` asset, where `<ns>` is `<brand>` with hyphens stripped (an asset id can't carry `-` in its first segment, so `--name acme-co` yields `assets/acmeco/…`). Ingest also *derives* the pack's photo-treatment and icon-theme palette documents under `catalog/assets/<ns>/palette/`, so uploaded photos get on-brand washes and themable icons get colour pairings out of the box (icon themes are skipped when the palette has no accent). `--register` upserts the pack into `profiles.json`; `--activate` also switches to it and rebuilds the catalog; `--out` picks a different destination and `--force` overwrites an existing pack. See [Design Tokens](/info/design-tokens.html) for the token model and [Quickstart](/info/quickstart.html) for the end-user brand flow.

### Brand lock

A brand's tokens asset can be marked authoritative (`brandLock` on its index entry). When locked, user-supplied tokens can't override the brand - `installUserTokens` is the single chokepoint and `isLocked()` the gate. The SUSE pack ships locked (its brand is non-overridable); `lolly-start` stays open so the blank-brand onboarding can write to it. Lock a pack when the brand must not drift; leave it open when you *want* end users to bring their own.

## Capability gating (per tool)

Each `tool.json` declares the host capabilities it needs (`schemas/tool.schema.json`). The valid flags are:

```
network · filesystem · clipboard · camera · microphone · screen · ffmpeg · wasm · capture · compose
```

A shell that can't provide a capability **disables** the tool rather than letting it fail - an `ffmpeg` tool is unavailable in the web PWA; a `microphone`/`camera` recording tool is unavailable in the headless CLI; a `capture` tool offers a browser add-on on Chromium and is marked desktop-only elsewhere. `screen` is *display* capture the user grants in browser-native UI (picking a screen, window or tab, via `host.recorder`) - distinct from `capture`, which rasterises a URL the tool itself names. This is how one catalog serves web, desktop, and CLI without per-shell tool lists. `network` access is additionally **allowlisted** - a tool declares which hosts it may reach, and `host.net` enforces it.

Notice the badge: URL Screenshot declares `capture`, the browser cannot provide it alone, so the tile offers the add-on instead of vanishing.

## Curating what users see

Two mechanisms narrow the catalog without forking it:

- **Per-instance tool set** - point each instance at a different profile (or a brand pack with a curated `tools/` root) so marketing, sales, and IT can each see a different library from one codebase.
- **Per-user feature flags** - surfaced in each person's Profile view, stored on their profile (so they sync). The gallery-category and Batch flags default to **on** (they show/hide whole gallery categories and the Batch entry), as do **Neurospicy Mode** (the focus-music player) and the **Jelly effects** UI switch; one privacy flag, **Strip metadata from uploads**, defaults to **off** (opt-in - see below). The category and Batch flags are purely personal preferences. Three of them - Neurospicy, Jelly effects and Strip metadata from uploads - can additionally be **governed** by an optional deployment control plane, which sets the default applied when the user hasn't chosen and can hide the switch entirely; a hidden flag's governed default wins over a stored user value. None of them ever gate output formats or any API surface. See [Getting Started → Administration](/info/operators.html) for the governance model around this.

  ![Every feature flag as its own switch, with the gallery categories on and Strip metadata off](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Fprofile%3Ffocus%3Dfeature-flags&width=1440&height=1800&dpi=192&waitMs=2000&format=svg&cropSelector=%23feature-flags-section&walker=1&filename=pd-feature-flags&sweep=1)

  **Strip metadata from uploads** is the one opt-in (default-off) flag: turn it on and images uploaded to your catalogue are scrubbed of EXIF, location (GPS), and other embedded metadata on import. Content Credentials (C2PA provenance) are *always* preserved either way - a signed or AI-generated image keeps its credential whether the flag is on or off.

## Maturity & watermarking

A tool's `status` controls trust signalling, enforced by the engine, not by convention:

- `experimental` - every export is automatically watermarked by the host (the tool can't remove it), so work-in-progress can't be mistaken for finished output.
- `community` - no watermark, but flagged as community-maintained rather than brand-approved. The most-used value in the shipped packs.
- `official` - brand-approved, no watermark.

Promote a tool by changing one field in its manifest. The status is not an internal note: every surface shows it, so a reader knows what they are picking up before they open it.

## Catalog build & validation

The manifest is the source of truth; `catalog/tools/index.json` is **generated** and must not drift.

```bash
npm run build:catalog     # index.json + asset checksums + preview bundle
npm run validate:catalog  # schema + invariants: checksums, file existence,
                          #   bindToProfile fields, palette refs, replacedBy chains
```

`validate:catalog` fails CI if the generated index drifts from the manifests, so run `build:catalog` after any `tool.json` or asset edit. Tool and asset **IDs are permanent contracts** - version in the manifest, never rename the path.

## Engine & runtime knobs

Most runtime behaviour is fixed contract rather than deploy-time config, but two things are worth knowing:

- **Engine version** - `ENGINE_VERSION` in `engine/src/version.ts` (read the live value there; `engine/CHANGELOG.md` tracks every minor). The capability bridge is additive-only within a major, so shells and tools built against an older minor keep working. See [Host API](/info/host-api.html).
- **Hook budgets** - `HOOK_BUDGET_MS` in `engine/src/runtime.ts` time-boxes async tool hooks (`onInit` 5s, `onInput` 2s, export hooks 5–10s). It's exported for tests; async overruns are abandoned, sync overruns only logged (hooks are not a sandbox - see [Operators](/info/operators.html#good-to-know)).

## The services' own config

- **CA service** reads `services/ca/.env` for provider credentials and certificate policy (`CA_CERT_DAYS` default 30, `CA_CERT_MAX_DAYS` default 365, allowed day set). Policy stays server-side; see the [Content Credentials Identity](/info/content-credentials-identity.html) operator runbook.
- **MCP server** exposes hosted endpoints with OAuth; self-hosting and the tool surface are covered in [MCP Server](/info/mcp.html).

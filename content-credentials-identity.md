# Content Credentials identity - verified signing for on-device C2PA

> **In plain terms.** Every image, PDF, or video you export from Lolly can carry a
> **Content Credential** - a signed [C2PA](https://c2pa.org) manifest, created
> entirely on your device - that proves the file hasn't been altered since it left
> Lolly, and (once you enrol an identity) records *who* signed it. Anyone can check
> it offline: hit **Verify** in the app (the shield in the bottom bar), drop in a
> file, and Lolly reports the result on-device. **Nothing is uploaded** - not the
> file, not the check. This page is the user-facing story; the [engineering &
> operator guide](/info/content-credentials-engineering.html) covers how it's built
> and how to run the CA service.

## What you get

- **Tamper-evidence, on by default.** The credential is a cryptographic seal over
  the exported bytes. Change a pixel and the seal breaks - the verifier says so.
- **Verifiable identity, when you want it.** Enrol once (SUSE, GitHub, Google, or
  an email link) and your exports are signed by a short-lived certificate that
  names *you*. Verifiers pinning the Lolly root then report **Verified - signed by
  \<your email\>** instead of an anonymous signer. Enrolment is optional; skip it
  and you still get tamper-evidence from an anonymous on-device signer. Know
  before you enrol: your email address is written into every file you export
  while enrolled. It stays in every copy you share and cannot be removed later,
  even after the certificate expires. For a team, consider enrolling a shared
  role address rather than a personal mailbox.
- **Honest about its limits.** A credential is never inflated or silently
  downgraded. If a certificate has expired, you get a distinct *expired* state
  ("the bytes still match, but the short-lived signing certificate has lapsed"),
  never a false green and never a misleading red. See the verdicts below.
- **Private and offline.** The signing key is generated on your device and is
  **non-extractable** - even Lolly's own code can't read it. Signing happens
  locally; only certificate *issuance* ever touches the network, and only when you
  choose to enrol.

## Verifying a file

![The Verify screen with nothing but a drop target - no upload button, no account, because the check runs where the file already is](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Fverify&width=1440&height=900&dpi=192&waitMs=1400&walker=1&format=svg&cropSelector=.valid-layout&dark=1&filename=cc-verify-drop&sweep=1)

The **Verify** tab (canonical `/verify`; the aliases `/valid` and `/v` redirect to
it) checks any file's credential entirely on-device. It reads the whole C2PA
manifest store - Lolly's own credentials **and** credentials written by other C2PA
tools (it reads both C2PA 1.x and 2.x claims, so files from cameras, Adobe apps,
Google's Gemini, and other generators verify too) - and headlines the result with
one honest verdict:

| Verdict | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Made with Lolly** | The credential is intact and records a Lolly export - the file hasn't changed since it was made. (Integrity plus the maker's claim, from an on-device key.) |
| **Verified** | The file matches what it signed **and** the signing certificate chains to the pinned Lolly CA root - integrity plus a CA-verified identity. |
| **Delivered by Lolly** | A genuine catalog asset Lolly distributed but didn't author - chains to the Lolly root, so it's intact and its origin is CA-verified; who made it is recorded below. |
| **Likely made with Lolly** | An amber middle ground: the credential's own signature and everything it references check out and it records a Lolly export, but the file's bytes no longer match the hard binding - it was probably re-saved, re-encoded, or re-uploaded through something that left the manifest intact. |
| **Credential intact** | The structure checks out and the bytes match, but the signer isn't identified (an anonymous on-device key). |
| **Credential expired** | The bytes still match exactly - nothing was modified - but the short-lived signing certificate has lapsed, so the credential no longer validates. |
| **Credential broken** | The file carries Content Credentials, but they no longer match its bytes - modified after signing, or the manifest is damaged. |
| **No Content Credentials** | Nothing to verify - the file carries no C2PA manifest. |

The page also shows the recorded edit history, the "made from" ingredients, and -
when present - the CA-verified signer's email and issuer. And it reads far more than
the credential: a file that declares AI-generated content, carries Lolly's own pixel
Imprint, or is quietly hiding data in its bytes gets flagged too - see [Beyond the
credential](#beyond-the-credential-what-else-verify-shows) below.

![The Change history panel, where every step names the software that made it and Lolly's own leg of the journey reads green](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Fverify%3Fsrc%3D%2Finfo%2Fthe-flood.webp&width=1440&height=1400&dpi=192&waitMs=6000&walker=1&format=svg&cropSelector=.valid-steps&dark=1&filename=ai-stance-change-history&sweep=1)

The same credential check runs in the CLI (`lolly validate <file>`) and in any
third-party C2PA validator pointed at the public Lolly root
(`c2patool --trust_anchors lolly-root.pem`).

## Beyond the credential: what else Verify shows

Verify is more than a C2PA reader. Every file you drop is put through several
independent checks, summarised as a row of pips ("Verification checks at a glance")
under the headline verdict and then explained in full below it. **They all run on
your device - nothing is uploaded.** The one network touch that can ever happen is
called out where it applies: a **one-time detector download** for the opt-in deep
scan (from the app's own origin, not a third party). SEAL verification in the web
app makes **zero network requests** - a record whose key lives in DNS resolves only
in the desktop/CLI shells, through your own machine's DNS. The file itself never
leaves.

### The Lolly Imprint

Alongside its Content Credential, Lolly can seal an **invisible watermark into the
pixels themselves** - the *Lolly Imprint*. Where the credential travels in metadata
and is lost to a re-save, a screenshot, or a metadata strip, the Imprint rides in
the image and survives recompression - so it's a durable hint that an image came
from Lolly even after the credential is gone. It's a supporting signal, not a
cryptographic guarantee. When Verify finds it, a green **Lolly Imprint** pip joins
the scorecard - marked *detected*, or *in an image* when the mark sits in a raster
embedded inside a PDF or PPTX. The Imprint is now **on by default** on raster
exports; see [Exporting → Provenance & watermark](/info/exporting.html#provenance-watermark).

![The Lolly Imprint switch in the export panel, already on, with the question mark opening what it does and does not promise](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Ftool%2Fqr-code%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Flolly.tools%26format%3Dpng%26options%26c2pa%3D90%26imprint%3D1&width=1440&height=900&dpi=192&waitMs=2200&format=svg&css=%23tool-inputs%2C%23sidebar-utils%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&cropSelector=.export-imprint&walker=1&dark=1&filename=cc-export-imprint)

### AI-generated content

When a file declares that its pixels came from a trained model, Verify raises an
unmissable **AI-generated content** flag (or **Contains AI-generated content** when
only part of it was). The declaration comes from one of two places, and Verify says
which: a signed **C2PA assertion**, or a bare **IPTC "digital source type"** tag
written into the file's metadata - the sidecar flag Gemini/Imagen, Midjourney and
Meta AI write next to their output. The metadata tag is genuine when present but
trivially stripped, so its *absence* never proves a file isn't AI-made. The flag
fires across JPEG, PNG and SVG stills and MP4/QuickTime video.

### "Likely carries" a maker's own watermark

Large AI generators also stamp *their own* invisible watermark into the pixels -
Google's **SynthID** (also adopted by OpenAI) or Meta's **Video Seal**. **Only the
maker's own detector can read those; Lolly cannot.** So when a file's declared maker
is one of them, Verify says the file *very likely carries* that watermark. This is a
**likelihood inferred from the maker's declaration**, never a claim that Lolly read
the watermark itself.

### Deep scan (opt-in): TrustMark & Content Seal

For a real read of two open pixel watermarks, Verify offers an opt-in **deep scan**.
A one-click banner - *"Scan for invisible watermarks?"* - downloads the detector
models once (~90 MB), after which every image in the batch is scanned automatically,
all on-device, nothing uploaded. It reads two marks:

- **Adobe TrustMark** - a genuine, error-correction-verified decode. When the
  recovered payload passes its ECC check, Verify shows **Adobe TrustMark detected**
  with the recovered bytes: a real read, not a guess, so it earns a green pip.
- **Meta Content Seal** - a read of Meta's *open* Pixel Seal / Video Seal watermark.
  This has no error-correcting gate, so a decode that stays consistent across several
  re-encodings is reported as an amber **Meta Content Seal likely** - a statistical
  match, not a certainty (a flat or low-detail image can read as a false positive).
  It reads only the **open** watermark: Meta's production **"Muse"** image pipeline
  uses a separate proprietary variant Lolly cannot read, so a hit never means "Meta
  Muse" or "Meta AI", and absence rules nothing out.

### SEAL signatures (a cryptographic signature, *not* a pixel watermark)

Verify also checks for a **SEAL** record - the [hackerfactor SEAL](https://github.com/hackerfactor/SEAL)
format, which despite the name has **nothing to do with Meta's Content Seal above**.
SEAL is a **cryptographic signature over the file's bytes** whose public key is
published in **DNS**. Lolly verifies it on-device - and in the web app with **zero
network requests**: a record carrying its key inline verifies fully offline, and a
DNS-keyed record reports "no key resolver" rather than being looked up through a
third-party DNS service. The desktop and CLI shells resolve DNS-published keys
through your own machine's DNS; a signature that verifies against a key found that
way shows **Signed by \<domain\> (SEAL)**: it proves **control of that domain** -
domain-level attribution, not a CA-verified legal identity - and says nothing about
the visual content. A signature that verifies
against a key the file itself carries, but which isn't confirmed in DNS, is reported
as internally consistent but unattributed.

### Hidden data: appended payloads & steganalysis

Two more reads look for data a file is quietly carrying:

- **Appended payloads.** Bytes tacked on *after* a container legitimately ends -
  after a PNG's `IEND`, a JPEG's `EOI`, a GIF trailer, or an APNG - are flagged as
  **Appended data found**, and you can **View** the extracted bytes (a safe hex or
  text preview) or **Download** them. The legitimate motion-photo case - a video
  appended to a still - is recognised and shown as **Appended video data** with no
  warning.
- **LSB steganalysis.** A chi-square analysis of the image's least-significant bits
  looks for the statistical fingerprint of LSB-hidden data; a match raises an amber
  **LSB steganography likely** heuristic. It's a hint, not proof.

Separately, every file's embedded **metadata** (EXIF/GPS/IPTC/XMP) is read out in
full and grouped, with values that could identify a person, place or device marked -
alongside a one-click **Download a cleaned copy** and a link to the **Hidden Data**
tool to strip it.

### Where each check runs

The C2PA verdict runs in the CLI too (`lolly validate <file>`). The embedded-metadata
read (EXIF/XMP, the AI declaration, appended-data) runs over MCP (`lolly_verify`) and in
the web **Verify** view. The pixel-level reads - the Lolly Imprint, the opt-in deep scan,
and LSB steganalysis - and SEAL verification are features of the web **Verify** view.
Wherever they run, they run on your machine.

## Why identity, not app identity

Lolly's engine and shells are open source. Once the code is public, "made with
Lolly" can never be a *cryptographic* claim - anyone can fork the repo and emit
bit-identical manifests. No certificate scheme fixes that, because the thing
being attested (the software) is copyable by design.

So the certificate attests **who signed, not what app signed**: the Subject
Alternative Name carries the OIDC-verified email. A fork can't impersonate a
Lolly user - it can only obtain certificates for *its own* users under our
issuance policy, or run its own CA whose root simply isn't our root. The
"Lolly" generator name in the manifest remains self-asserted, and the verifier
copy keeps making that distinction (which is why "Made with Lolly" is the maker's
claim, while "Verified" is the cryptographic one).

This follows Kerckhoffs's principle as practised by Sigstore/Fulcio and
Let's Encrypt: **the repo holds no secrets - only protocol and public
anchors.** The CA *certificate* (public) is committed and served; the CA
*private key* lives only in the host's environment store (or a KMS); the device
key is generated locally and non-extractable.

## Trust tiers (what a verifier can conclude)

| Tier | Signer | Verifier result |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Ephemeral self-signed (offline / not enrolled) | Structure valid, signer anonymous ("Credential intact" / "Made with Lolly") |
| 1–2 | Device key + short-lived Lolly-CA cert | CA-verified identity ("Verified" / "Delivered by Lolly") for verifiers pinning the Lolly root |
| 3 (roadmap) | + RFC 3161 timestamp countersignature | proves *when* signed, so expired certs stay verifiable |
| 4 (roadmap) | C2PA conformance program (audited KMS custody) | green in third-party validators (Adobe Verify etc.) |

**Expired-credential honesty:** certificates are short-lived and there is no
trusted timestamp yet, so a file verified after the cert expired gets a
distinct *expired* verdict - the bytes still match, but the time of signing can't
be proven - never silently downgraded to broken, never inflated to verified.

## Credential lifetime (7 / 30 / 90 / 365 days, default 30)

Until the timestamp authority lands (Tier 3), the certificate window does
double duty: it bounds abuse (expiry is our only revocation) **and** it is how
long an exported file keeps its verified badge - the verifier compares the
cert window against *verification* time, not signing time. So the lifetime is
the user's call, offered at the moment the certificate is actually minted:

![The C2PA Credentials card carrying its own Expires picker, so the window is chosen on the export that uses it](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Ftool%2Fqr-code%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Flolly.tools%26format%3Dpng%26options%26c2pa%3D90%26imprint%3D1&width=1440&height=900&dpi=192&waitMs=2200&format=svg&css=%23tool-inputs%2C%23sidebar-utils%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&cropSelector=.export-c2pa%5Bdata-c2pa-only%5D&walker=1&dark=1&filename=cc-c2pa-lifetime)

- **Not enrolled (ephemeral path):** the self-signed cert is generated fresh
  per export, so the **export panel's Content Credentials card** carries the
  7/30/90/365 select directly - it sets the credential's validity window on that
  export. Default 30. Fully offline.
- **Enrolled (CA identity):** the cert is fixed at enrolment, so the same
  7/30/90/365 select lives in **Profile → Content Credentials** next to the
  provider buttons; the CA clamps the chosen value to the allowed set
  {7, 30, 90, 365} (policy stays server-side). The export panel then shows
  *"Signed as \<email\> · verified until \<date\>"* in place of the picker, with a
  renew nudge when expiry is near. A per-export choice can't exist here - you
  can't sign with validity your certificate doesn't have, and re-issuing at export
  time would break offline signing.
- **URL / CLI:** `c2pa` is a reserved URL-mode param (see [URL Mode](/info/url-mode.html)):
  `?c2pa=90` on a share/deep-link URL sets a 90-day ephemeral window (and pre-sets the
  export panel), `c2pa=off` forces it off, and the CLI accepts the same as `--c2pa=90`.
  A CLI render is credentialed **by default**, exactly as an export from the app is
  (plans/73-cli-ga-contract.md §12 O2). `--no-provenance` is the one-word opt-out, and the
  way to get byte-identical output run to run. The default signer there is the ephemeral
  on-device one - *browser* enrolment is a browser feature, because the device key is
  generated non-extractable and cannot be handed to a terminal - but the CLI can sign
  with an identity you already hold: `--sign-key=<key.pem> --sign-cert=<chain.pem>` puts
  your own certificate chain in the manifest, and a verifier pinning its root reads the
  file as **Verified**. See [Signing from the terminal](/info/cli-signing.html).

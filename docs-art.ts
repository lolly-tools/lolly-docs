/**
 * Banked docs art — the masthead bank and the figure bank (plans/105 §6).
 *
 * Two directories, one pipeline. `docs/mastheads/<id>.svg|.html` is a stable
 * library a page maps into by slug; `docs/figures/<page-slug>-<name>.svg|.html`
 * is bespoke artwork a page references from its own prose with a
 * `::: figure <id>` fence. Both are signed at bank time
 * (scripts/sign-docs-art.ts) and both are INLINED into the page here.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM build.ts. Everything here is pure —
 * it reads a file and returns a string — and docs/build.ts runs its own
 * `build()` on import, so nothing in that file can be exercised by a test
 * without building the whole site. The parts a test must be able to prove (the
 * manifest really leaves the inlined copy; the ids really get namespaced; the
 * credential really points at the same file that was inlined) live here.
 *
 * ── The design axiom: presentation copy ≠ verification copy ──────────────────
 *
 * A C2PA hash binding covers FILE BYTES, not DOM. Inlining an artifact takes the
 * file off the page, so the inlined copy MUST NOT carry the manifest: a reader
 * who saved that markup out of devtools would hold a file whose credential fails
 * to validate — a false negative on a genuine Lolly asset, which is worse than
 * no credential at all. The signed file stays served at /info/<bank>/<file> and
 * the credential line points there, so "Check it yourself", "Get the signed
 * file" and "Copy signed source" all act on the real bytes.
 *
 * That is the same contract SHOWCASE_SCRIPT keeps at runtime for the one inlined
 * screenshot on the site (docs/build.ts). Its strip + id-namespace rules are the
 * ones promoted here, and {@link stripArtForInline} is the single build-time
 * implementation both banked paths use. The showcase's copy stays inline in that
 * script because it runs in the browser; tests/docs-figures.test.ts pins the two
 * in step.
 *
 * The strip is also VERIFIED rather than assumed: if a carrier survives it (a
 * shape neither rule anticipated), the inline is refused and the caller warns.
 * A page with no art is a small loss; a page shipping a broken credential is a
 * claim we cannot stand behind.
 *
 * ── The same-file rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A localized variant (`<id>.<lang>.svg`) is its OWN banked, signed artifact.
 * Everything downstream — the bytes inlined, the path the credential is read
 * from, the URL its actions point at — is derived from the ONE filename this
 * module resolved, never re-derived from the id. What the reader sees is what
 * the credential describes.

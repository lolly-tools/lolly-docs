# Build Guide

> **Scope.** This page is *how each artefact is produced*: getting the source, toolchain prerequisites and the per-platform build, signing and packaging steps. The [Deployment guide](/info/deployment.html) is *where each artefact runs* - delivery models, hosting and routing for the web shell and what the optional MCP and CA services need. Compilers, SDKs and store submission here; hosts, rewrites and rollout there.

How to build Lolly for each distribution target: standalone CLI binary, desktop app (macOS / Windows / Linux), mobile apps (iOS / Android) and the web shell as a container image for Kubernetes.

---

## Prerequisites (all targets)

- <!--l:node-->**Node.js ≥ 22.18** (the 22 LTS line) **or ≥ 24**, and **npm 10+**. The repo's scripts run TypeScript sources directly (`node scripts/foo.ts`), which relies on Node's unflagged type-stripping - added in Node 22.18 and 24. Node 20 and early 22.x fail at `npm install`. `.nvmrc` pins `22`, so nvm users can just run `nvm install` in the repo.
- The repo and its submodules checked out, dependencies installed - see below

---

## Getting the source

Lolly is a parent repo plus a set of git submodules. The parent owns `engine/`, `schemas/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `api/`, `brands/lolly-start/` and `profiles.json`; everything else is mounted from its own repository under [github.com/lolly-tools](https://github.com/lolly-tools):

| Path | Repository | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `community/` | `lolly-tools` | the brand-agnostic tool definitions |
| `docs/` | `lolly-docs` | this documentation |
| `shells/web` | `lolly-web` | the PWA |
| `shells/cli` | `lolly-cli` | the scriptable CLI |
| `shells/tui` | `lolly-tui` | the interactive terminal shell |
| `shells/tauri-desktop` | `lolly-desktop` | the desktop app |
| `shells/tauri-mobile` | `lolly-mobile` | the iOS / Android app |
| `shells/chrome-extension` | `lolly-chrome-extension` | the browser extension |
| `services/mcp` | `lolly-mcp-server` | the MCP server |
| `services/ca` | `lolly-ca` | the Content Credentials CA |
| `brands/suse` | `suse-lolly` | **private** - the SUSE tool pack and catalog |

All of those except `brands/suse` are public, so a read-only contributor gets a complete, buildable checkout with the script (or single command) below. Write access is enforced by the host at push time, not by the checkout, so the setup is identical whether you're a maintainer of a given repo or just reading it.

### The setup script

On macOS and openSUSE, one script takes a fresh clone to a running state - it detects your package manager (<!--l:homebrew-->Homebrew or zypper), installs git and Node if they are missing or too old, initialises every public submodule, runs `npm install` and selects a content profile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lolly-tools/lolly.git
cd lolly
./setup.sh                # public setup: community tools + the blank "lolly-start" brand
npm run dev:web           # web shell at http://localhost:5173
```

`./setup.sh` is idempotent - safe to re-run any time: after a `git pull`, or to repair a half-finished checkout. Flags:

- `--suse` also mounts the private SUSE brand pack and selects the SUSE profile (needs repo access)
- `--profile <suse|lolly-start>` forces a content profile after install
- `--skip-node` leaves Node entirely to you - the nvm path: `nvm install` in the repo (it reads `.nvmrc`), then `./setup.sh --skip-node`
- `--help` lists everything

### By hand

If you'd rather run the steps yourself, prefer SSH remotes with each submodule on a branch from the start or are on a distro the script doesn't cover:

```bash
git -c url."git@github.com:".insteadOf=https://github.com/ \
    clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:lolly-tools/lolly.git && \
cd lolly && \
git config url."git@github.com:".insteadOf https://github.com/ && \
git submodule foreach 'git checkout main' && \
npm install
```

What each step is for:

- **`url.insteadOf`** rewrites the HTTPS URLs recorded in `.gitmodules` to SSH. SSH clones work for public repos regardless of write access, so this is safe for everyone - and it means the submodules you *can* push to are already set up to push, with no per-repo remote fiddling later. Repeating it as a `git config` after the clone makes the rewrite stick for future `git submodule update` runs. Drop both lines if you'd rather authenticate over HTTPS.
- **`--recurse-submodules`** checks out every submodule in the table except `brands/suse`, which is marked `update = none` in `.gitmodules` precisely so that public clones and CI skip the private pack and fall back to the neutral `lolly-start` profile.
- **`git submodule foreach 'git checkout main'`** puts each submodule on a branch. Submodules clone in detached HEAD, and a commit made there is easy to lose. Every submodule's default branch is `main`. Note this moves each one to the remote tip, which can sit ahead of the commit the parent recorded; `git submodule update` returns them to the recorded commits if a build starts behaving oddly.
- **`npm install`** must run *after* the submodules exist, because the npm workspaces resolve against a `package.json` in each one. Its `postinstall` runs `scripts/use-profile.ts --auto`, which builds the gitignored `tools/` and `catalog/` profile views - see [Configuration](/info/configuration.html).

Verify the result with `npm run profile` (shows the active profile) and `npm run cli` (lists the tools it can see).

### The private SUSE brand pack

`brands/suse` holds the SUSE tool pack and its catalog, including licensed fonts and music, so it lives in a private repository. If you have access, opt in explicitly:

```bash
git submodule update --init --checkout brands/suse
npm run profile:suse
```

(`./setup.sh --suse` does both in one go.) Without it, `npm run profile` reports `lolly-start` as active - the blank brand, which is the correct default for anyone not doing SUSE-specific work, and the profile the public site and CI build against.

### If something fails

- **`npm install` dies with a syntax error in a `.ts` file** - your Node is too old for type-stripping; you need ≥ 22.18 or ≥ 24 (`node -v`). With Homebrew, note `node@22` is keg-only: add `export PATH="$(brew --prefix node@22)/bin:$PATH"` to your shell profile.
- **`Cannot find module '@lolly-tools/…'` or a workspace `package.json` is missing** - the submodules weren't checked out before `npm install`. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`, then `npm install` again.
- **`brands/suse` won't clone** - it's private. Drop `--suse`; you land on `lolly-start` and everything still builds and runs.
- **A tool edit doesn't show up, or ends up in the wrong repo** - `tools/` and `catalog/` at the repo root are gitignored symlink views into the packs, so edits flow through to the pack checkout and commits belong *inside* the owning submodule - see the next section.

### Working across submodules

A change inside a submodule is always **two commits**: one in the submodule repository, and one in the parent to move the recorded pointer. Push the submodule first, or the parent will point at a commit nobody else can fetch.

One case deserves care. `catalog/tools/index.json` is generated **per brand**, and every brand's index lists the community tools - so editing a community `tool.json` leaves every *other* brand's index stale, and the single-profile `npm run build:catalog` can't see the drift because it only ever looks at the active view. After any community tool change, run the all-profiles variants instead:

```bash
npm run build:catalog:all      # rebuild every mounted profile, then restore the active one
npm run validate:catalog:all   # validate every mounted profile; exits 1 on drift (the CI guard)
```

Day-to-day submodule workflow - syncing, status across all repos, verification - lives in `scripts/subrepo/README.md` in the parent repo.

## CLI

### Development use (no build needed)

The CLI shell runs directly from the repo with Node.js:

```bash
# List available tools
npm run cli

# Show inputs for a tool
npm run cli -- qr-code

# Run a tool and write output
npm run cli -- qr-code --url=https://suse.com --color=#0c322c --output=./qr.svg

# Explicit format
npm run cli -- quotes --quote="Open source wins." --name="Andy" --export=png --output=./quote.png
```

The CLI supports **SVG, EMF, EPS, HTML and the text/data formats** (JSON, CSV, ICS, VCF, MD, TXT) natively - hydrated by the engine with no browser engine needed (SVG/EMF only for tools with an `<svg>`-based template, since the lean CLI has no layout engine). **PNG** from an `<svg>`-based tool is also browser-free: resvg rasterises the engine's own SVG (Tier A). The remaining raster formats - **JPG, WebP, PDF and video (GIF, WebM, MP4)**, plus HTML-layout PNG - render through the CLI's own scoped headless Chromium (Tier B): install it once with `lolly install-browser`, then they export straight from the CLI. (ZIP is the one format the lean CLI leaves out - no zip dependency - so its batch writes a folder instead.)

### Standalone binary

To distribute the CLI without requiring Node.js installed:

**1. Bundle to a single CJS file:**

```bash
cd shells/cli
npx esbuild bin/lolly.ts \
  --bundle \
  --platform=node \
  --target=node20 \
  --format=cjs \
  --outfile=dist/lolly.cjs
```

**2. Package with `@yao-pkg/pkg` (includes a Node runtime):**

```bash
npx @yao-pkg/pkg dist/lolly.cjs \
  --targets node20-macos-arm64,node20-macos-x64,node20-linux-x64,node20-win-x64 \
  --output dist/lolly
```

Output binaries land in `shells/cli/dist/` - one per platform target.

> The `tools/` and `catalog/` directories must ship alongside the binary. The CLI resolves them relative to the binary location, so the expected layout is:
> ```
> lolly          ← binary
> tools/              ← tool definitions
> catalog/            ← asset + tool catalogs
> ```

---

## TUI

### Development use (no build needed)

The interactive terminal shell runs straight from the repo - it needs a real TTY, so run it in your terminal rather than a captured pipe:

```bash
npm run tui
```

It's the CLI's engine and render path under an interactive, keyboard-first UI (built on Ink, run through `tsx`). The DOM-free formats - **SVG, EMF, EPS, HTML and the text/data formats** - render with nothing extra. State (saved sessions, project folders, profile) persists on disk under `~/.lolly` (override with `$LOLLY_TUI_DIR`); exports default to `~/Desktop`. See the [TUI guide](/info/tui.html) for the full key map and views.

### Browser render tier (raster / PDF / video / URL capture)

Unlike the bare CLI, the TUI can produce browser-bound formats via a scoped headless Chromium - the same one the MCP server uses. Set it up once:

```bash
npm run install:browser   # Chromium → services/mcp/.browsers (shared with services/mcp)
npm run build:web         # a built web shell the TUI drives for pixel-identical raster/pdf/video
```

With those present, raster (PNG/JPG), PDF, video and the `url-shot` live-URL capture all export from the terminal; without them, those formats fail with a clear setup message and the TUI writes HTML instead. The browser is lazy - it launches only on the first such export, never at startup. Override the browser with `LOLLY_BROWSER_CHANNEL` / `LOLLY_BROWSER_PATH`, or point at a running/prebuilt web shell with `LOLLY_WEB_BASE` / `LOLLY_WEB_DIST`.

> No standalone-binary recipe yet - the TUI ships as a repo/dev surface today. Package it like the CLI (esbuild + `@yao-pkg/pkg`) once a target calls for it.

---

## Desktop app (macOS / Windows / Linux)

### Prerequisites

<!--l:rust-->**Rust toolchain:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update
```

<!--l:tauri-->**Tauri CLI (Node package - installed per-shell):**

```bash
cd shells/tauri-desktop
npm install
```

**Platform build tools:**

| Platform | Required |
|---|---|
| macOS | Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) |
| Windows | Microsoft C++ Build Tools or Visual Studio with C++ workload |
| Linux | `build-essential`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libappindicator3-dev` |

Full list: https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

### Icons

Tauri requires icon files at `src-tauri/icons/`. Generate them from a 1024×1024 source PNG (the build will fail with a missing-file error if this step is skipped):

```bash
cd shells/tauri-desktop
npx @tauri-apps/cli icon path/to/icon-1024.png
```

This writes all required sizes and formats (`32x32.png`, `128x128.png`, `128x128@2x.png`, `icon.icns`, `icon.ico`, etc.) to `src-tauri/icons/`.

> Placeholder icons committed to the repo are solid-green squares - replace them with production artwork before releasing.

### Development

```bash
cd shells/tauri-desktop
npm run dev
# or from repo root:
npm run dev:desktop
```

Tauri opens a native window. The Vite dev server runs in the background; hot reload works. The state bridge uses the filesystem override (`bridge-overrides/state.ts`) - saved states go to `$APPDATA/Lolly/saved-state/`.

### Production build

```bash
cd shells/tauri-desktop
npm run build
# or from repo root:
npm run build:desktop
```

This runs `vite build` (producing `dist/`) then `tauri build`. Output:

| Platform | Artifact | Location |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `.app` + `.dmg` | `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/` |
| Windows | `.msi` + `.exe` NSIS installer | `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` |
| Linux | `.deb` + `.AppImage` | `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` |

### Cross-compilation

Tauri does not support cross-compilation out of the box. Build each platform on its native OS, or use a CI matrix (GitHub Actions `macos-latest` / `windows-latest` / `ubuntu-latest`).

---

## Mobile apps (iOS / Android)

### Prerequisites

**In addition to the Rust toolchain and Tauri CLI above:**

#### Android

1. <!--l:android-->Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. In SDK Manager, install:
   - Android SDK Platform (API 33 or higher)
   - NDK (Side by side) - version 26+
   - Android SDK Command-line Tools
3. Set environment variables:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk   # macOS
export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/$(ls $ANDROID_HOME/ndk | tail -1)
```

4. Add Android Rust targets:

```bash
rustup target add \
  aarch64-linux-android \
  armv7-linux-androideabi \
  i686-linux-android \
  x86_64-linux-android
```

#### iOS (macOS only)

1. <!--l:apple-->Install Xcode from the App Store (the full app, not just the Command Line Tools)
2. Accept the license: `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`
3. Install CocoaPods - `tauri ios init` generates a Podfile and runs `pod install`: `brew install cocoapods`
4. Add iOS Rust targets:

```bash
rustup target add \
  aarch64-apple-ios \
  aarch64-apple-ios-sim \
  x86_64-apple-ios
```

See [Building for iOS](/info/ios-build.html) for the full iOS walkthrough - prerequisites, one-time init, the simulator dev loop, code signing and camera permissions.

### First-time platform init

Run once to generate the native project files (`gen/android/` or `gen/apple/`):

```bash
cd shells/tauri-mobile
npm install

# Android
npm run tauri android init

# iOS
npm run tauri ios init
```

The `gen/` directory contains the generated Gradle / Xcode projects. It is gitignored - regenerate it with the init command on a fresh checkout.

### Icons (mobile)

```bash
cd shells/tauri-mobile
npx @tauri-apps/cli icon path/to/icon-1024.png
```

### Development

**Android** (emulator or connected device with USB debugging enabled):

```bash
cd shells/tauri-mobile
npm run dev:android
# or from repo root:
npm run dev:android
```

**iOS** (macOS only - requires Simulator or provisioned device):

```bash
cd shells/tauri-mobile
npm run dev:ios
# or from repo root:
npm run dev:ios
```

### Production build

```bash
# Android - outputs APK + AAB
npm run build:android
# or: npm run build:android from repo root

# iOS - outputs .ipa
npm run build:ios
# or: npm run build:ios from repo root
```

**Android signing** - set these env vars before building for release:

```bash
export ANDROID_KEY_STORE=/path/to/keystore.jks
export ANDROID_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=...
export ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=...
export ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=...
```

**iOS signing** - configure your Development Team in Xcode:

```bash
cd gen/apple
open Lolly.xcodeproj
```

Set the team in the project's Signing & Capabilities tab, then build from CLI or Xcode.

---

## Open Build Service (OBS)

[Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org) is SUSE's source-to-package build system. It compiles a single source definition into native packages for many distributions at once, in clean and reproducible network-isolated chroots, and publishes them through signed, hosted repositories. One Lolly package definition on OBS can target the whole Linux matrix below from the same source.

### What OBS can build for Lolly

| Format | Distributions | Lolly artifact packaged |
|---|---|---|
| RPM | <!--l:opensuse-->openSUSE Leap / Tumbleweed, SLE / SLES, <!--l:fedora-->Fedora, RHEL / CentOS / Alma / Rocky, Mageia, openEuler | CLI binary and/or Tauri desktop app |
| DEB | <!--l:debian-->Debian, <!--l:ubuntu-->Ubuntu, Raspbian | CLI binary and/or Tauri desktop app |
| Arch | <!--l:arch-->Arch Linux (`PKGBUILD`) | CLI binary / desktop app |
| <!--l:flatpak-->Flatpak | distro-agnostic sandboxed desktop app | Tauri desktop app |
| AppImage | distro-agnostic portable app | reuses Tauri's `.AppImage` output |
| Container images | OCI / <!--l:docker-->Docker (built via Kiwi or a `Dockerfile`) | CLI as a container image |
| Appliance / disk images | ISO, VM and cloud images (built via Kiwi) | full preloaded image |

The local Tauri build already emits a `.deb` and an `.AppImage` (see the Desktop table above). OBS does not replace that - its value is **fan-out across the rest of the matrix** (every RPM- and deb-based distro, Arch, Flatpak, containers, appliances) plus **signed, hosted repositories** that users can add and update from like any other system package.

### How it fits Lolly's artifacts

OBS packages one of the two Linux artifacts this guide already produces:

- **The standalone CLI binary** - the esbuild + `@yao-pkg/pkg` output from the CLI section above. The `tools/` and `catalog/` directories must ship alongside the binary (the CLI resolves them relative to its own location), so that layout carries straight into the package's `%files` (RPM) or `debian/install` (deb) list.
- **The Tauri desktop app** - the `tauri build` output, packaged as RPM / DEB / Flatpak / AppImage for desktop delivery.

### Build-environment constraints

> **No network at build time.** OBS builds inside clean, network-isolated chroots, so every build input must be present up front. For a Node + Vite + Rust/Tauri app this is the main porting effort: vendor the npm and Cargo dependencies (an offline npm cache / `cargo vendor`) or supply them through OBS source services, and declare the toolchain as `BuildRequires` - e.g. `nodejs>=20`, `npm`, `rust`, `cargo`, plus the desktop build's GTK/WebKit `-devel` packages (`libgtk-3-dev`, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libappindicator3-dev` and equivalents).

### Illustrative project layout

The snippets below are **illustrative starting points, not a production-tested recipe** - they show what an OBS package for Lolly looks like.

A `_service` file fetches and versions the source from git at build time:

```ini
<services>
  <service name="obs_scm" mode="manual">
    <param name="scm">git</param>
    <param name="url">https://github.com/lolly-tools/lolly.git</param>
    <param name="revision">v1.0.0</param>
    <param name="versionformat">@PARENT_TAG@</param>
  </service>
  <service name="set_version" mode="buildtime"/>
  <service name="tar" mode="buildtime"/>
</services>
```

A trimmed RPM `.spec` declares the toolchain, builds the artifact and installs it with the required `tools/` + `catalog/` layout:

```spec
Name:           lolly
Version:        1.0.0
Release:        0
Summary:        Lolly - template-driven creative asset generator
License:        MPL-2.0
URL:            https://lolly.tools
Source0:        %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz

BuildRequires:  nodejs >= 20
BuildRequires:  npm
BuildRequires:  rust
BuildRequires:  cargo

%build
npm ci --offline
# CLI binary: bundle with esbuild, then wrap with @yao-pkg/pkg (see CLI » Standalone binary above).
# For the desktop app instead, run `npm run build:desktop`.
npx esbuild shells/cli/bin/lolly.ts --bundle --platform=node \
  --target=node20 --format=cjs --outfile=shells/cli/dist/lolly.cjs
npx @yao-pkg/pkg shells/cli/dist/lolly.cjs \
  --targets node20-linux-x64 --output shells/cli/dist/lolly

%install
install -Dm0755 shells/cli/dist/lolly %{buildroot}%{_bindir}/lolly
cp -a tools   %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/lolly/tools
cp -a catalog %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/lolly/catalog

%files
%license LICENSE
%{_bindir}/lolly
%{_datadir}/lolly/
```

A matching `debian/` directory (`control`, `rules`, `install`) produces the `.deb` from the same OBS package, and OBS's per-repository configuration maps that single package onto every distribution target you enable.

A Flatpak manifest wraps the Tauri desktop bundle:

```yaml
app-id: org.lolly.Lolly
runtime: org.gnome.Platform
runtime-version: '46'
sdk: org.gnome.Sdk
command: lolly
modules:
  - name: lolly
    buildsystem: simple
    build-commands:
      - npm ci --offline && npm run build:desktop
      - install -Dm0755 src-tauri/target/release/lolly /app/bin/lolly
    sources:
      - type: archive
        path: lolly-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

For readers wiring this up for real, see the [OBS documentation](https://openbuildservice.org/help/) and the [openSUSE packaging guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines).

<!--lb:kubernetes helm-->

## Web shell on Kubernetes (Helm)

The web shell is a **static site** - `npm run build:web` produces a `dist/` folder of HTML, CSS, JS, the service worker, the HarfBuzz WASM, fonts, the bundled tool catalog and the `/info` site. Anything that can serve static files can host it (which is why the production site runs behind a CDN). To run it **inside your own Kubernetes cluster** - air-gapped, on-prem or alongside the rest of your platform - the artefacts ship in this repo: `deploy/docker/` bakes `dist/` into an <!--l:nginx-->nginx image, and `deploy/helm/` deploys it. This section is what those files do and how to adapt them; [Deployment](/info/deployment.html) is where each piece runs.

Nothing in the chart is specific to one cluster: it is plain Kubernetes, so it deploys on any conformant distribution - including SUSE's own RKE2 and <!--l:k3s-->k3s - and on any managed service.

> **The chart is shipped, the images are yours to build.** `deploy/helm/` is a real chart with three components - `web` (the PWA, on by default), `mcp` and `ca` (both opt-in) - one `values.yaml` you edit and secure defaults on every pod. What it cannot do is invent an image: build and push the three `deploy/docker/` images to a registry your cluster can reach, then pin the tags you verified. There is no hosted Lolly chart repository, so you install from a checkout of this repo, and the SUSE Application Collection carries no Lolly chart of its own. Where a curated image or chart *does* exist there - the nginx runtime base, cert-manager - this section prefers it.

### Why the SUSE Application Collection

<!--l:suse-->[The SUSE Application Collection](https://apps.rancher.io) is a curated, signed, continuously-rebuilt catalog of open-source container images and Helm charts, all based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Images (BCI). Pulling the nginx runtime from it - rather than an arbitrary upstream tag - gets you a hardened, attested base with a known CVE posture.

| Host | Role |
|---|---|
| `apps.rancher.io` | Browse / catalog UI (and where you mint credentials) |
| `docs.apps.rancher.io` | Documentation |
| `dp.apps.rancher.io` | **OCI distribution registry you pull from** - images under `/containers/<name>`, Helm charts under `/charts/<name>` |

Access needs a free **SUSE Customer Center** account (`scc.suse.com`); sign in to `apps.rancher.io` and create either a personal **access token** (Settings → Access tokens) or an organization **service account** (Settings → Service accounts). Pulls are never anonymous.

> **Free-tier gotcha for clusters.** A *user* access token on the Free tier allows pulls (≈100/24h), but a Free **service account is allowed 0 pulls** - so unattended in-cluster pulls through a service-account `imagePullSecret` realistically need a paid (Prime or higher) organization subscription. For builds on your own laptop a personal token on the Free tier is fine. If you can't subscribe, use the SUSE BCI nginx image from `registry.suse.com` instead (see the *Fallback* note under step 2) - it's free and needs no login.

Log in - the same host for every client. The username/password pairing differs by credential type: a **user account** uses your username + an **access token**; a **service account** uses its username + a **secret** (never your account password):

```bash
helm registry login dp.apps.rancher.io -u <username-or-sa-username> -p <access-token-or-sa-secret>
docker login        dp.apps.rancher.io -u <username-or-sa-username> -p <access-token-or-sa-secret>
```

### 1. Build the image

`deploy/docker/web.Dockerfile` does the static build *and* the packaging in one multi-stage build, so there is no separate "run npm, then copy `dist/`" step to perform by hand. Two things it needs from you: the **build context must be the repo root**, and the content submodules must be checked out in it - a bare clone builds a shell with an empty catalog.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

docker build -f deploy/docker/web.Dockerfile \
  --build-arg LOLLY_PROFILE=suse \
  -t <your-registry>/lolly-web:0.1.0 .
docker push <your-registry>/lolly-web:0.1.0
```

What the two stages do:

- **build** - `node:26-bookworm`, pinned by digest, runs `npm ci` then the real `npm run build:web`. Deliberately not the slim variant: the optional native dependencies (sharp, onnxruntime, resvg, playwright) need build tooling slim doesn't carry.
- **runtime** - `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged`, also digest-pinned, running as uid 101 on port **8080**. `dist/` is copied to `/usr/share/nginx/html`, `deploy/docker/nginx.conf` becomes `conf.d/default.conf` and `deploy/docker/security-headers.conf` is copied beside it.

`--build-arg LOLLY_PROFILE=suse|lolly-start` bakes one brand into the static output - theme colour, PWA chrome and the resolved `tools/` + `catalog/` content. Nothing is read at serve time, which is why the chart needs no pack, config or volume mounted for the web app; changing brand means rebuilding the image and rolling the deployment.

`mcp.Dockerfile` and `ca.Dockerfile` follow the same pattern (repo-root context, digest-pinned `node:26-bookworm-slim`, non-root `node` user) and run their entry point on Node directly. Build them only if you enable those components.

### 2. Swapping in a SUSE nginx base (optional)

The shipped runtime stage uses the upstream unprivileged nginx image so a plain `docker build` works with no registry credentials. To take the Application Collection's curated build instead, replace that one `FROM` line and keep the `COPY` lines untouched:

```dockerfile
# ---- runtime stage: SUSE Application Collection nginx ----
# Pin the current tag from https://apps.rancher.io/applications/nginx
FROM dp.apps.rancher.io/containers/nginx:1.29.4
```

Two things to check against whichever base you pick. The shipped `nginx.conf` sets `root` explicitly, so the base image's default document root doesn't matter - but `dist/` has to be copied where that `root` points (or change the directive). And it listens on 8080 because non-root nginx cannot bind below 1024; if your base runs as root and you switch to 80, change `web.service.targetPort` in the chart to match.

> **Fallback without an Application Collection subscription:** use the free SUSE BCI image `FROM registry.suse.com/suse/nginx:1.27` (no login required). Its default document root is `/srv/www/htdocs/` - copy there instead, or just keep the `root` directive from the shipped `nginx.conf`, which wins regardless of the base image's default.

### 3. What the nginx config already handles

Lolly is a single-page PWA, so the server has real work to do: URL-mode deep links (`/?tool=qr-code`) must fall back to `index.html`, the service worker must never be cached, hashed assets should be immutable, the HarfBuzz `.wasm` and the `.webmanifest` need correct MIME types and the security headers have to be on every response. `deploy/docker/nginx.conf` does all of it - `tests/security-headers.test.ts` pins its CSP against the other two copies in the repo, so edit it rather than writing a fresh one. The parts that matter, quoted from the shipped file:

```nginx
server {
    # nginx-unprivileged cannot bind <1024; 8080 is the image default.
    listen       8080;
    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index  index.html;

    # Security headers on every response (see the $lolly_csp map above).
    include /etc/nginx/security-headers.conf;

    # ── Service worker: MUST never be cached, and may control the whole scope.
    location = /sw.js {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate";
        add_header Service-Worker-Allowed "/";
        include /etc/nginx/security-headers.conf;
    }

    # ── Content-hashed build output: safe to cache forever (immutable).
    location /assets/ {
        add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
        include /etc/nginx/security-headers.conf;
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    # ── Everything else: serve the file, then its .html twin, then a directory
    # index, then fall back to the SPA shell. Covers /t/<id> → /t/<id>.html and
    # /info/* real pages while keeping client-routed paths on index.html.
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/index.html /index.html;
    }
}
```

That repeated `include` is not redundancy: nginx drops **every** inherited `add_header` inside a location that declares one of its own, so any location setting `Cache-Control` would otherwise ship with no security headers at all. Keep the include when you add a location. The file also carries a cheap unauthenticated `/healthz` for the chart's probes, explicit `types` for `.wasm`/`.avif`/`.webmanifest`, long-cache rules for `/ort/`, `/models/` and `/fonts/` and the short URL aliases (`/d`, `/v`, `/c`, `/p`, `/profile`) that mirror the hosted deployment's rewrites.

### 4. The chart

The Application Collection ships charts for stateful services (redis, postgresql, prometheus, cert-manager, …) but **not** a generic static-web-server chart - nginx lives there as a *container image only*. Lolly's own chart is `deploy/helm/`:

```
deploy/helm/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml               ← the one file you edit
└── templates/
    ├── _helpers.tpl          names, labels, image references
    ├── web-deployment.yaml   the PWA (on by default)
    ├── web-service.yaml
    ├── mcp-deployment.yaml   MCP server (opt-in)
    ├── mcp-service.yaml
    ├── ca-deployment.yaml    credential authority (opt-in)
    ├── ca-service.yaml
    ├── ca-secret.yaml        chart-managed mode only
    ├── ingress.yaml          one Ingress per enabled component
    ├── networkpolicy.yaml    off by default
    ├── serviceaccount.yaml
    └── NOTES.txt
```

`web` is enabled by default at 2 replicas - the PWA holds no server-side state (everything lives in the browser's IndexedDB), so replicas are interchangeable and you can raise the count freely. `mcp` and `ca` are `enabled: false` until you turn them on. The security posture is shared and applied to every component: `runAsNonRoot`, `RuntimeDefault` seccomp, all capabilities dropped, no privilege escalation, a read-only root filesystem with `emptyDir`s mounted exactly where nginx needs to write, no ServiceAccount token mounted (none of the components talk to the Kubernetes API), soft pod anti-affinity so replicas spread across nodes without blocking a single-node cluster and an off-by-default NetworkPolicy that restricts ingress to each component's port.

The values you are most likely to touch:

```yaml
web:
  enabled: true
  replicaCount: 2
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/lolly-tools/lolly-web   # ← your registry
    tag: ""                                     # empty ⇒ the chart's appVersion
  service:
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080        # what nginx-unprivileged listens on
  ingress:
    enabled: false
    hosts:
      - host: lolly.example.com
        paths: [{ path: /, pathType: Prefix }]

# Private registry (see step 5). e.g. [{ name: application-collection }]
imagePullSecrets: []
```

Read `values.yaml` top to bottom before a production install - it is written to be read, and the `mcp` and `ca` sections document what each service needs.

### 5. Install

If the image (or its base) is pulled from `dp.apps.rancher.io`, create the pull secret first and name it in `imagePullSecrets`:

```bash
kubectl create namespace lolly

# the SUSE Application Collection pull secret (skip if your image is on a public registry)
kubectl create secret docker-registry application-collection \
  --docker-server=dp.apps.rancher.io \
  --docker-username=<username-or-sa-username> \
  --docker-password=<access-token-or-sa-secret> \
  -n lolly
```

The minimum viable install is one flag - the image you built in step 1. Port-forward to try it before you publish a hostname:

```bash
helm upgrade --install lolly ./deploy/helm -n lolly \
  --set web.image.repository=<your-registry>/lolly-web \
  --set web.image.tag=0.1.0

kubectl port-forward -n lolly svc/lolly-web 8080:80   # → http://localhost:8080/
```

To publish it on your own hostname with TLS from cert-manager (drop the `imagePullSecrets` line if your registry is public):

```bash
helm upgrade --install lolly ./deploy/helm -n lolly \
  --set web.image.repository=<your-registry>/lolly-web \
  --set web.image.tag=0.1.0 \
  --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=application-collection \
  --set web.ingress.enabled=true \
  --set web.ingress.hosts[0].host=lolly.example.com \
  --set web.ingress.tls[0].secretName=lolly-web-tls \
  --set web.ingress.tls[0].hosts[0]=lolly.example.com
```

`NOTES.txt` prints the resulting URLs, which components came up and any secret still missing.

### 6. The optional services

Both stay off until you ask for them, and both are stateless.

**MCP** (`--set mcp.enabled=true`) exposes the tool catalog to AI agents over Streamable-HTTP on port 8790. Its brand content is baked in at build time exactly like the web image. Browser-tier render formats are disabled unless you point it at a renderer - `--set mcp.webBase=https://lolly.example.com` - and SVG/data plus resvg-PNG work without one, which is why the image ships no Chromium. Probes are TCP socket checks: there is no unauthenticated health route to poll.

**CA** (`--set ca.enabled=true`) issues short-lived certificates for on-device C2PA signing on port 8787, under `/api/ca`. It needs a root key and certificate, generated once with `node services/ca/scripts/gen-root.mjs`, plus a service secret (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Two ways to supply them: fill in `ca.secrets` and let the chart create the Secret, or - the production choice - set `ca.existingSecret` to one your platform's secret store manages and leave `ca.secrets` empty. The chart refuses to render rather than deploy a CA with a missing root. Set `ca.config.allowedOrigins` to your web host, or enrollment tokens are rejected.

### TLS, the SUSE-curated way (optional)

For HTTPS, pull **cert-manager** - which *is* a real chart in the Application Collection - and let it issue the Ingress certificate:

```bash
helm install cert-manager oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/cert-manager \
  -n cert-manager --create-namespace \
  --set crds.enabled=true \
  --set 'global.imagePullSecrets={application-collection}'
```

Then add a `ClusterIssuer` (e.g. Let's Encrypt), point the chart's `web.ingress.tls[0]` at a secret name and annotate the Ingress for cert-manager through `web.ingress.annotations` (`cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod`); `mcp` and `ca` take the same three keys under their own sections. Every Application Collection chart accepts the same `--set 'global.imagePullSecrets={application-collection}'`, so the pattern carries across redis, postgresql, prometheus and the rest if Lolly ever grows backing services.

> For the authoritative, current registry paths, tags, chart versions and value keys, see the [SUSE Application Collection docs](https://docs.apps.rancher.io) and run `helm show values oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/<chart>` before relying on any default.

## How the Tauri shells relate to the web shell

Both Tauri shells share the web shell's source (`shells/web/src/`). They build it with a Vite alias that swaps `bridge/state.ts` for a Tauri filesystem implementation at build time. Everything else - the engine, tools, templates, export logic - is identical to the web build. One render path, three delivery targets.

```
shells/web/src/         ← canonical source
    └── bridge/
        └── state.ts    ← IndexedDB (web build)

shells/tauri-desktop/
shells/tauri-mobile/
    └── bridge-overrides/
        └── state.ts    ← filesystem via tauri-plugin-fs (Tauri builds)
```

The Tauri-built frontend is written to `shells/tauri-{desktop,mobile}/dist/`, which `tauri.conf.json` references as `frontendDist`. The web shell's own `dist/` is unaffected.

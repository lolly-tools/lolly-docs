# Driving Lolly from an AI agent

Give your model a **deterministic, reviewable creative layer** instead of asking it to hallucinate pixels. A tool invocation is just a **URL with parameters** - a few tokens that produce a press-quality file, the same way every time. No image model, no creative drift, no data leaving the device.

## The model: a URL is the API

Every tool is fully described by its URL. The agent's job is to build that URL (or the equivalent CLI command) from structured inputs:

```
https://<host>/#/tool/<tool-id>?<input>=<value>&<input>=<value>
```

Open it and the tool renders with those inputs applied. Add reserved params to control output and trigger a download. Same inputs → same output, always - so results are reproducible, auditable, and version-controllable.

```
Use Lolly to generate the conference badge:
  tool: event-name-badge
  eventName: "KubeCon 2026"   firstname: "Ada"   lastname: "Lovelace"   company: "SUSE"
Return the file URL.
```

## Discover a tool's inputs

Don't guess parameters - read them. The tool's manifest (`tools/<id>/tool.json`) lists every input id, type, and default, or use the CLI:

```bash
npm run cli -- event-name-badge  # prints inputs, defaults, and supported formats
npm run cli                      # lists every available tool
```

Feed that schema to the model so it only emits valid inputs.

## Reserved parameters

These are the common ones; anything outside the full reserved set is a tool input. (Full reference: [URL Mode](/info/url-mode.html).)

| Param | Effect |
|---|---|
| `format` | Output format (`png`, `svg`, `pdf`, `mp4`, …) |
| `export` | Presence flag - render and **download immediately** on load |
| `copy` | Presence flag - copy the result to the clipboard on load |
| `width` / `w`, `height` / `h` | Output size (value in `unit`) |
| `unit`, `dpi` | Physical sizing (`mm`/`cm`/`in`/`pt`) + raster resolution |
| `bleed`, `marks` | Print bleed and crop marks |
| `profile` | Colour profile - raster ICC (`srgb`/`none`) or CMYK press condition |
| `filename`, `output` | Download filename / CLI output path |
| `password` | Lock the exported PDF |
| `_v` | Pin the tool version for stable output |
| `slot` | Open a saved session |

The complete reserved set also includes `full`, `options`, `c2pa`, `imprint`, `lang`, `nostage`, `z` and `zx`; everything else is forwarded to the tool as an input. (The engine's `RESERVED` set in `engine/src/url-mode.ts` is the source of truth - see [URL Mode](/info/url-mode.html).)

So a one-shot, ready-to-download link is just:

```
/#/tool/qr-code?url=https://suse.com&format=svg&export
```

## Getting an actual file

- **Interactive / in a browser session:** append `&export` (or `&copy`) - the file downloads (or lands on the clipboard) on load.
- **Headless / server-side automation:** use the **[CLI](/info/cli.html)** - it's the same parameter surface and writes bytes to a file or stdout:

  ```bash
  npm run cli -- qr-code --url=https://suse.com/kubecon --color=0c322c \
    --export=svg --output=./qr.svg
  ```

  (The lean node CLI renders SVG and text/data formats; raster/PDF/video need the desktop-bundled build - see [CLI](/info/cli.html).)

  Pipe stdout straight into another step in your pipeline.

A few tools won't hand back a file this way:

- **Non-exporting utilities** (`color-palette`, `countdown-timer`, `strip-data`, `text-helper`, `compress-pdf`) set `render.export: false` - `&export`/`&copy` are no-ops.
- **Experimental tools** (those with `status: "experimental"` in their manifest) watermark every export until they're promoted, so their output isn't press-clean yet.
- **File-input tools** like `strip-data` transform the user's own bytes in memory; they need a file the agent can't supply through a URL (see the device-local note below).

## The MCP server (native endpoint)

Beyond building URLs by hand, Lolly ships an optional **[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server** - a native endpoint any MCP client (an agent runtime, an IDE, a CLI, a hosted assistant) connects to directly. It exposes the catalogue and the render path as callable tools, so an agent can discover a tool, fill its declared inputs, and get back a finished file plus an editable `lolly.tools` link - with no app update, because tools sync to the server as data.

Five verbs:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `lolly_list_tools` | List / search the catalogue (by text, status, category, format, capability). |
| `lolly_describe_tool` | One tool's full input JSON Schema, supported formats, canvas size, examples. |
| `lolly_build_url` | Build a shareable, editable link + raw render URL - without rendering. |
| `lolly_render` | Render a tool to a file (returns the bytes plus the editable link). |
| `lolly_transform` | Run an on-device file utility (`strip-data`, `compress-pdf`) on a file you supply. |

### Any format, transparently

`lolly_render` returns whatever format the tool declares - the server picks how to produce it, and the agent never has to know which engine ran:

- **Vector** - `svg`, `pdf`, `pdf-cmyk`, `eps`, `emf`, `dxf` (cut file)
- **Raster** - `png`, `jpg`, `webp`, `avif`, `tiff`, `cmyk-tiff`, `ico`
- **Animation** - `gif`, `apng`, `webp-anim`, `svg-anim` (vector), `webm`, `mp4`
- **Documents & data** - `pptx` (PowerPoint), `html`, `md`, `txt`, `json`, `csv`, `ics`, `vcf`, `zip`

Formats are **per-tool** - you can only request one a tool declares (`lolly_describe_tool` lists them). Ask a QR tool for `svg` and you get vector; ask an animated-ad tool for `mp4` and you get video - the call shape is identical either way.

### Connect a client

The recommended endpoint is the **full** one - **`https://mcp.lolly.tools/mcp`** (a browser-free serverless endpoint at `https://lolly.tools/api/mcp` also exists, for vector/data output only). Connect either one of two ways - both authenticate against the same shared access token, which your Lolly operator holds (it is never printed in a link or a log). Full reference: the **[MCP Server](/info/mcp.html)** page.

**A custom connector (OAuth).** The endpoint is also a stateless **OAuth 2.1** authorization server, so it drops straight into any MCP client that supports custom connectors:

1. In your client's connector settings, add a custom connector pointing at `https://mcp.lolly.tools/mcp`. (Hosted assistants usually expose this under a *Connectors* or *Integrations* panel; on team/enterprise plans an admin typically adds it once for everyone.)
2. Leave the OAuth Client ID / Secret blank - the server registers your client automatically (dynamic client registration).
3. The client auto-discovers the OAuth server and opens a consent page. Paste the access token and approve - done.

Nothing is stored server-side: the client registration, the authorization code, and the tokens are all short-lived signed values verified with a shared secret on each call (PKCE-protected, so a leaked link can't be replayed).

**A bearer token (CLI / any HTTP client).** The endpoint also accepts the raw token directly, so scripted clients skip the OAuth dance. Most MCP clients take a config entry like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lolly": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.lolly.tools/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <your-access-token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

(Or run it locally over **stdio** during development - no token needed.)

### A hosted add-on - not offline or edge

The MCP server is the one part of Lolly that is a **server-side add-on**, not an on-device component. Producing the full format range - animations, print PDF, HTML-layout raster - means driving a **headless browser against a built web shell**, so the full endpoint runs as a hosted service and is **not suitable for offline or edge deployments**. That full endpoint is live at **`https://mcp.lolly.tools/mcp`**; the lightweight serverless endpoint at `lolly.tools/api/mcp` runs the browser-free tier only (vector, data, and PNG for SVG-native tools). The on-device shells - web PWA, desktop, mobile and CLI - remain the offline / air-gapped path. See the **[MCP Server](/info/mcp.html)** page for the full reference.

## Why this beats prompting an image model

- **Quality doesn't drift.** Layout, type, colour, and spacing are structural - hard-coded by the tool author, not prompted. A lazy model can't degrade them.
- **Cheap.** A parameterised URL is a handful of tokens versus thousands for a brief + generation - and the result is production-grade.
- **Deterministic & auditable.** Every output is reproducible from its inputs; pin `_v` for byte-stable results across tool updates.
- **Private by default.** It runs on the device - no customer data sent to a third-party model or service.

## Tips

- **Pin `_v`** in automation so a tool update can't silently change output.
- **Compact encodings:** some tools define short `urlKey` aliases and tilde-delimited arrays to keep links short - see [URL Mode](/info/url-mode.html).
- **Validate against the schema** before emitting a URL; unknown params are ignored and bad input values fall back to defaults, so a malformed call fails quietly rather than loudly.
- **Device-local images** (user uploads) can't travel in a URL - agents should reference catalog assets by id, not local uploads.
- **One tool, many outputs:** change `format`/`unit`/`width` to emit the same design as SVG, print PDF, and social MP4 from one set of inputs.
- **Portable embed URL:** an agent can emit `https://lolly.tools/tool/<id>.<ext>?<inputs>` (image extensions `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `svg`, plus animated `gif` and `apng`) and drop it straight into HTML as an `<img src=…>`. It renders locally in the live web view - nothing is fetched from lolly.tools.

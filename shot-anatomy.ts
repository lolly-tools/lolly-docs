/**
 * Count what a committed docs screenshot is actually MADE of, at build time, so the
 * credential line can state it rather than assert it.
 *
 * The claim the /info screenshots make is that they are documents, not pictures:
 * real <path> geometry that zooms, diffs and re-renders. "12,400 paths in 41 KB" is
 * that claim in a form a reader can check against the file they were just served —
 * and against the PNG they would otherwise have been sent. A raster baseline has no
 * such structure, and says so instead of borrowing the sentence.
 *
 * Counted with regexes over the file text, never a DOM. These files reach 500 KB
 * (one is 6.8 MB) and the docs build re-runs on every save under --watch, so parsing
 * 95 MB of SVG into a tree twenty-seven times over would cost more than every other
 * part of the build put together. Start tags are all that is being counted, XML
 * escapes any literal `<` in text, and the numbers are self-evidently approximate to
 * one decision (see the metadata strip below) that is documented rather than hidden.
 *
 * Cached on path+size+mtime like docs/shot-provenance.ts, for the same reason: a
 * 27-locale build asks for the same ~320 files once per locale.
 *
 * Total by construction. Anything unreadable — a missing file, a permissions error,
 * bytes that do not look like markup — returns null, and the caller simply leaves
 * the facts off the line. A credential must never be the thing that breaks a build.

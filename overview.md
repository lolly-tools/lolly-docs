# Overview

This document captures the purpose, structure, and architectural decisions for the Lolly platform. It reflects both the product vision and the current state of the codebase.

> **Status:** Lolly is an internal prototype in a **closed pilot that hasn't completed**. The engine is deterministic and internally consistent, but the product is early — SUSE is customer number one — and its cryptography and file-parsing engines have **not** been externally security-audited. Read the architecture below as design intent under test, not a finished, certified product. See [Adoption & Governance](/info/adoption-governance.html#status) for how the pilot is run and measured.

## Why this exists

Brand teams face a recurring problem: recurring creative work that is too predictable to justify a designer's time, but too brand-sensitive to hand off without guardrails. The result is either slow throughput (designer bottleneck), inconsistency (people using whatever tool they have), or vendor lock-in (a SaaS DAM that controls your templates).

This platform is the structural answer:

> **Programmatic creative at scale** — zero-labor asset generation, with central brand control, for employees, vendors, and partners.

The outcome is **brand abundance**: every event has correct signage, every CVE alert is on-brand, every email signature is current, all without a design ticket. The platform handles recurring operationalised creative. It is deliberately not a bespoke creative tool — designers still own flagship work.

### Where it fits in the landscape

| Capability | Canva | Brandfolder | Illustrator | Figma / Penpot | **Lolly** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mass content generation | partial | ✅ | partial | ✅ | ✅ |
| Offline availability | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Template logic / constraints | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Generative design | ❌ | ✅ | partial | partial | ✅ |
| Low skill required | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Easy internal access | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Intuitive editor (end user) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Intuitive editor (designer) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Live collaboration | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

The gap is clear: nothing in the existing landscape gives us constraints-first, offline-capable, low-skill, internally accessible output. Lolly even includes an open canvas — **Layout Studio** — where colours, type and assets conform to the brand globals, so free arrangement stays constraints-first. What it is **not** is an unconstrained design suite: designers continue to use Illustrator and Figma for bespoke flagship work. Permutations can be assembled with this tool.

**Use it for:** Rapid generation of operationalised creative assets — event tiles, name badges, signatures, CVE alerts, QR codes, social cards.

**Do not use it for:** Bespoke hero content.

## Platform delivery model

The platform runs across several surfaces — web PWA, Tauri desktop/mobile, the scriptable CLI, and the interactive TUI. All of them use the same engine and the same tool files.

### Web (PWA) — primary distribution
Hosted at a SUSE-controlled URL. Works offline once the service worker has cached tools and assets. This is where most employees, vendors, and partners will use the platform. No account required — state is stored in IndexedDB per device.

The web shell is responsive from one layout. On desktop a tool is a resizable controls sidebar beside a preview stage with trackpad-native canvas navigation (Cmd/Ctrl-wheel or pinch to zoom about the cursor, Space- or middle-drag to pan, `0`/`1`/`+`/`−` keys, and a Fit/% HUD). On mobile (≤640px) the controls become a top-anchored sheet with a drag grip that snaps peek/half/full (tap toggles) over a static full-screen preview, and a floating **Render** button opens the **Export** controls in a bottom-sheet popup. Touch gets pinch-zoom and drag-pan on the preview. The render path and the export controls are identical across both — only the chrome reflows.

**Batch mode (`/pro`).** The web shell also ships a spreadsheet-style batch grid (`shells/web/src/pro/`) that renders many rows at once across one or many tools. It does CSV/TSV round-trip plus spreadsheet paste, per-row template/format/size/unit/dpi, a blocks-editor side panel with a live preview, collapsible export columns, a per-row "relevance" tag bar, left drag-handle row reorder, two-step delete confirm, saved batch sessions, and a `.zip` download. This is the one-to-many surface behind the "mass content generation" positioning.

### Tauri desktop / mobile
Packaged native app (small footprint via Tauri). Provides full offline availability, filesystem access for CLI-dependent tools (PDF Smasher, Font Outliner), and camera access. Scheduled for mid-2026 tooling enhancement.

### CLI
`lolly <tool-id> [--input=value ...] --output=file.png`

Desktop users can invoke many tools from the terminal. The CLI shell loads the same engine, creates a jsdom DOM, runs the same render path, and writes the file. URL mode is the transport — CLI is not a separate implementation. This guarantees CLI and GUI outputs are identical.

```bash
lolly qr-code --url=https://suse.com --output=qr.svg
lolly quotes --quote="Ship it." --output=quote.png
lolly                        # lists available tools
lolly qr-code                # lists inputs for that tool
```

### TUI
`npm run tui`

The interactive counterpart to the CLI: a full-screen, keyboard-first terminal app (built on Ink) for browsing tools, filling in inputs, saving projects, and exporting — all without a GUI. Its host bridge **reuses the CLI's implementation** for the DOM-free formats (SVG/EMF/EPS/HTML + text/data), and adds on-disk state under `~/.lolly` plus an opt-in inline preview. Beyond that it has a **browser render tier**: a scoped headless Chromium (the same one the MCP server installs) that produces raster/PDF/video and live-URL capture on demand — driving a built copy of the web shell so output is identical, and launching only when you first export such a format. So `url-shot` (with crop + recolor + vector PDF/SVG) and every raster/pdf tool run in the terminal too. See the [TUI guide](/info/tui.html).

---

## Tool categories

Tools are tagged with a `category` in their manifest for gallery grouping.

Rows are listed in gallery section order. The `utility` section always renders **last** in the gallery (after every other category, including future ones) — it's the on-device "Offline Utilities" drawer.

| Category | Shipped tools | Planned |
|---|---|---|
| `everyone` | QR Code Generator, Quote Card, Email Signature, Day Brief, Code Canvas, Color Block, Dynamic Layout, Logo, Web Icon Maker | Employee Image Stationery |
| `designer` | Brand Lockup, Bag Video, Chart Creator, Street Map, Animated Ad, Multi-Page PDF, Diagram Builder, Logo Lockup: Grid (NASCAR), Logo Lockup: Partner, Filter: Duotone, Filter: Halftone, Filter: Scanline, Filter: Posterize Bitmap, Filter: Pixel Stretch | Font Outliner |
| `event` | Meeting Planner, Event Name Badge, Wayfinding Signage, Calendar ICS | Event Stationery, Bulk Name Badges, Room Agenda Cards |
| `product` | — | CVE Alert, Product Release Announcement, Blog OG Image |
| `utility` | Countdown Timer, Color Palette, URL Screenshot, Strip Hidden Data, Text Helper, Compress PDF, Layout Studio | Unit/format converters, more on-device privacy utilities |

Tools are also classified by status: `official` (brand approved, no watermark), `community` (external contribution), `experimental` (watermarked exports). Dynamic Layout, URL Screenshot, Logo Lockup: Grid (NASCAR), Filter: Posterize Bitmap and Diagram Builder currently carry `experimental` status; Web Icon Maker and Layout Studio ship as `community` tools.

**Layout Studio** is the first tool built on the `render.layout: "editor"` free-canvas mode — a chromeless, direct-manipulation surface where you drag, resize, rotate and snap boxes of text, shapes and images, then export through the same render path as every other tool.

**Strip Hidden Data** is the first **on-device utility** (`privacy: "on-device"`): a content-transform tool that takes a file *you* supply, processes it entirely in the browser, and hands back a clean copy — never uploaded, never watermarked, no provenance stamped. **Text Helper** is the second — an on-device workbench for everyday paste-into-a-website jobs (JSON format, JWT decode, Base64, URL encode/decode, SHA hashing). **Compress PDF** is the third — it shrinks a PDF by recompressing its images, again entirely on-device. All three carry the badge text "Runs on your device — nothing is uploaded". This is the start of a privacy-utility category that replaces handing confidential files to single-purpose websites.

> Note: `category` and `status` are denormalised into `catalog/tools/index.json` (the registry the gallery reads) from each `tool.json`. The manifest is the source of truth — the index is **generated** by `npm run build:catalog` and `npm run validate:catalog` fails CI if the committed index drifts from the manifests.

## Architectural commitments

These decisions are settled. Changing any of them is a major undertaking — they shape every other decision in the codebase.

### 1. Declarative tools, with an imperative escape hatch

A tool is a manifest (`tool.json`) + a template (`template.html`) + optional `hooks.js`.

**The manifest declares inputs.** Not the template. Inputs are not inferred from Handlebars tokens. The manifest is the contract; the template consumes named variables by `{{id}}`.

**Hooks are optional.** Most tools are pure declarative — manifest + template is enough. Tools needing computed values (QR encoding, chart data shaping) provide `hooks.js` exposing named lifecycle functions (`onInit`, `onInput`, `onFrame` — the per-frame live-camera hook for motion-reactive tools — `beforeRender`, `beforeExport`, `afterExport`, and `exportFile` — the file-in/file-out transform path used by on-device utilities like Strip Hidden Data). The host loads hooks via `new Function('host', …)` with the capability bridge injected as closure scope. This is a **portability contract, not a security sandbox**: hooks still run in the page realm and *can* reach `window`/`fetch`/`document` in a browser shell — `host.*` is the supported, portable surface, not an enforced boundary. Async hook results are time-boxed (onInit 5s, onInput 2s, others 5s) and late results discarded; a runaway *synchronous* hook cannot be preempted. Untrusted third-party hook code is therefore not safe to run until Worker isolation ships.

This matters because: declarative tools can be authored by non-developers. If every tool were a web app, the risk note "limited skills to create/maintain workhorse templates" becomes a permanent bottleneck.

### 2. Tools and assets are data, not bundled code

The web and Tauri apps fetch tool and asset catalogs from a known URL at boot, cache them locally, and operate on whatever is there. **Adding a new event tile or seasonal asset does not require an app release.**

Asset bytes are SHA-256 checksummed to prevent CDN poisoning. Asset `id` + `version` drives cache invalidation.

### 3. The Capability Bridge is the only API tools see

Tools never touch the DOM outside their template area, never call `fetch` directly, never read the filesystem. They call versioned `host.*` methods. The bridge is defined in `engine/src/bridge/host-v1.ts`:

| Bridge API | What it does |
|---|---|
| `host.profile` | User's firstname, email, headshot, city, etc. Pre-fills inputs via `bindToProfile`. |
| `host.assets` | Catalog queries, asset resolution, host-provided picker UI. |
| `host.state` | Save / load input slots. IndexedDB on web, filesystem on Tauri, memory on CLI. |
| `host.clipboard` | Write text or image to clipboard (with platform fallbacks). |
| `host.export` | Rasterise or serialise the render target. Applies watermark for experimental tools. |
| `host.net` | Allowlisted fetch — only available if the tool declared `"network"` capability. (No shipping tool currently uses it.) |

Optional, additive surfaces appear only when a shell provides them. Two are **capability-gated** — exposed only when the tool declares the matching flag: `host.compose` (embed another tool's render — `compose`) and `host.capture` (page capture for URL Screenshot — `capture`). The rest are **feature-detected** — present whenever the shell can provide them: `host.text` (text-to-path via HarfBuzz WASM; the `wasm` capability flags tools that rely on it), `host.pdf` (PDF parsing/compression, used by Strip Hidden Data and Compress PDF), and `host.tokens` (DTCG design tokens). The declarable capabilities are: `network`, `filesystem`, `clipboard`, `camera`, `ffmpeg`, `wasm`, `capture`, `compose`.

The same tool runs in browser, Tauri, and headless CLI because each shell implements this interface — the tool never knows which it's in.

The bridge is versioned. Adding methods is a minor version. Removing or changing signatures is a major version bump. When v2 ships, v1 must continue to work.

### 4. Asset IDs are forever

`suse/logo/primary` is a contract. Once published:
- The ID never changes, never gets reused.
- Byte changes → bump `version` in the manifest.
- Replaced by a new asset → set `deprecated: true` and optionally `replacedBy`.
- Existing references always resolve.

This makes saved tool states and URL-shared links durable across years.

### 5. URL mode is first-class

Every input must be expressible as a URL parameter:

```
lolly.tools/#/tool/qr-code?url=https://suse.com&ecl=H
```

CLI mode is URL mode under a different transport — the CLI shell builds a URL-state object from argv and runs the **same** engine pipeline. There is one render path. CLI cannot drift from GUI because it isn't a separate implementation.

`url-mode.ts` handles the round-trip (parse and serialize). Reserved params (never forwarded to the tool as inputs): `format`, `export`, `copy`, `slot`, `output`, `filename`, `_v`, `z` (packed state — the "Shortest link" token), `width`/`w`, `height`/`h`, `unit`, `dpi`, `profile`, `password`, `bleed`, `marks`, `full`, `options`, `nostage`. Asset inputs in URL mode are serialised by their `id`; the runtime resolves them via `host.assets.get()` before hydration. `width`/`height` are values in `unit` (default `px`, also `mm`/`cm`/`in`/`pt`/`pc`); with a physical unit `dpi` sets raster resolution. They set the canvas document size and pre-fill the export dimensions panel.

### 6. Storage goes through the bridge, not direct

Web shell: IndexedDB. Tauri: filesystem. CLI: in-memory. Tools see only `host.state.save(slot, data)` and `host.state.load(slot)`. `localStorage` is not used — it's too small and can't hold blobs.

Users can save multiple named edit slots per tool and return to each session later. No account creation is required; state is per-device. Because the bridge is the only seam, that per-device state is also *portable*: `shells/web/src/data-transfer.ts` reads everything back out through `host.profile`/`host.state`/`host.assets` into a single `lolly-backup` zip that imports on any other install — the offline answer to "move to a new device" that doesn't need a server (full spec: `docs/data-transfer.md`). SUSE ID integration (multi-device sync) is a future milestone on top of this.

### 7. Maturity tags answer the "brand approved" risk structurally

Every tool declares `status: official | community | experimental` in its manifest. The gallery sorts by status. Experimental tools watermark their exports automatically — the watermark is applied by `host.export.render`, not by the tool, so it cannot be opted out of by a non-official tool author.

This is a structural answer to the perception risk that using any tool implies brand approval. Process answers (a review queue, SUSE ID gating) layer on top.

### 8. Tool inputs are typed via the manifest, including assets

Inputs declare a `type`: `text`, `longtext`, `number`, `boolean`, `color`, `select`, `asset`, `date`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `url`, `profile`, `blocks`, `vector`, and `file`. The host renders a generic control per type from the manifest — tools write zero control code. Three carry more weight than the rest:

- **`asset`** (with `filter` and `allowUpload`) is the bridge to the global asset system; `allowUpload: false` is the brand-enforceability lever for things like sponsorship-tile logos where only library assets are permitted. User uploads use the same `AssetRef` shape as library assets, so tools handle them identically.
- **`blocks`** is a repeating field-group — a mini-table inside one input, edited in a side panel, with a typed/discriminated add menu and per-block asset fields. Clicking a rendered block on the canvas focuses that block's row. Used by `meeting-planner`, `chart-creator`, `event-name-badge`, `wayfinding-signage`, `color-block`, and `digi-ad`.
- **`vector`** groups a fixed set of numbers (e.g. a transform) into one compound control; **`file`** holds the user's own file as bytes in memory for on-device transform utilities (e.g. `strip-data` and `compress-pdf`).

### 9. Templates are logic-less (Handlebars, not EJS)

Handlebars was chosen over EJS deliberately:
- Logic-less. Templates can be authored by non-developers.
- Safe by default. `{{x}}` HTML-escapes; `{{{x}}}` is opt-in raw.
- No arbitrary JS in templates means no per-template XSS audit surface.

Logic lives in `hooks.js` where it is explicit and reviewable. Available Handlebars helpers: `{{default}}`, `{{upper}}`, `{{lower}}`, `{{eq}}`, `{{markdown}}`, `{{asset ref}}`, `{{asset ref "property"}}` (plus data-format helpers `icsStamp`/`rfcText`/`csvCell` used by sibling `.ics`/`.vcf`/`.csv` templates).

### 10. Tools compose tools

A tool can embed **another** tool's render with no tool-to-tool imports — composition is resolved by the engine, never by tool code. There are two surfaces:

- **Declarative manifest** — `composes: [{ id, tool, inputs, format?, width?, height? }]`. The engine renders the named child and places the result in the logic-less template as `{{asset <id>}}`. `event-name-badge` composes `qr-code` as an SVG today.
- **Portable embed URL** — `<img src="https://lolly.tools/tool/<id>.<ext>?<inputs>">`. The shell renders that child **locally** (a placeholder pixel shows until the local render resolves); nothing is ever fetched from `lolly.tools`.

Compose any tool's render: an **SVG** child stays a true vector when the parent exports to SVG or PDF and rasterises crisply for PNG; **PNG/JPG/WEBP** children embed as images. Requires the `compose` capability. Composed children are intermediates — never watermarked or provenance-stamped — and composition degrades gracefully: a shell that can't render a child just omits the slot and the parent still renders.

## What we explicitly chose not to do

- **No EJS / no arbitrary JS in templates.** XSS surface is zero. Logic lives in `hooks.js`.
- **No asset CMS.** The asset catalog is git. Updates go through PR review. No upload UI, no auth, no moderation queue. The git review _is_ the moderation.
- **No RBAC in MVP.** Public access. Brand risk managed by maturity tags + watermarks + the structural fact that all assets users see came through PR review.
- **No central database.** All user state is per-device. SUSE ID integration is on the roadmap but not a launch blocker.
- **No shared tools/engine code path.** The engine is open source; `tools/` and `assets/` remain proprietary SUSE content in their own repositories. The separation is enforced (no cross-imports) so the split stays clean.

## Lifecycle, end to end

A user opens `lolly.tools/#/tool/qr-code?url=https://suse.com&ecl=H`:

1. **Boot.** Web shell opens IndexedDB, constructs the capability bridge, syncs the tool and asset catalogs (or loads from cache when offline).
2. **Route.** URL hash → `tool` view, with `qr-code` and URL params extracted.
3. **Load.** `loadTool('qr-code', fetchFile)` fetches `tool.json`, validates against the JSON Schema, fetches `template.html`, `styles.css`, and `hooks.js` source.
4. **Parse URL state.** `parseUrlState` translates URL params into initial input values. Asset refs (`?logo=suse/logo/primary`) are parsed as lightweight `{ id, _unresolved: true }` objects.
5. **Runtime.** `createRuntime(tool, host, initialValues)` builds the input model (merging profile data, defaults, and initial values), resolves asset refs via `host.assets.get()`, loads hooks (closure-scoped `host`, not sandboxed), calls `hooks.onInit`.
6. **Render.** Shell subscribes to runtime; on every state change it receives `{ model, hydrated }`. It renders input controls from the model and writes the hydrated template HTML into `#tool-canvas`.
7. **Interact.** User types in an input → `runtime.setInput(id, value)` → constraints applied → `hooks.onInput` called → re-hydrate → re-render. The canvas updates live.
8. **Export.** User clicks Download(PNG) → `runtime.export(canvasNode, 'png')` → `host.export.render` (rasterises via dom-to-image-more; SVG/PDF go through dedicated DOM-walking vectorisers) → blob → `host.export.download`. The format range a tool can opt into is broad: `svg`, `png`, `jpg`/`jpeg`, `webp`, `avif`, `pdf`, the vector formats `emf`, `eps`, plus the print/CMYK formats `pdf-cmyk`, `cmyk-tiff`, `eps-cmyk`; the video formats `webm`, `mp4`, `gif`; and data/text formats `html`, `md`, `txt`, `json`, `csv`, `ics`, `vcf`, `ico`, `zip`. (Tools that set `render.export: false` — e.g. Color Palette, Countdown Timer, Strip Hidden Data, Text Helper, Compress PDF — hide the download/format/dimension controls.) Physical units are converted per format here (PDF → true page points, raster → pixels at DPI with a `pHYs` chunk). Authorship/provenance metadata (author, tool, source — built by `engine/src/metadata.ts`) is embedded per format: PNG iTXt, JPEG EXIF, PDF info dict, SVG `<metadata>`, GIF comment. Experimental tools get a watermark inserted by the host, not the tool.

Same lifecycle in Tauri. Same lifecycle in CLI — jsdom provides the headless DOM; output goes to a file or stdout.

## Open-source status

The `engine/`, `shells/`, `schemas/`, and `docs/` directories are open source under **MPL-2.0** — a vendor-neutral scaffolding platform for brand tooling, with each shippable unit split into its own repository under [github.com/lolly-tools](https://github.com/lolly-tools). `tools/` and `catalog/assets/` are SUSE-specific content and remain **proprietary to SUSE** (all rights reserved — see each repo's `NOTICE.md`); they are not covered by the MPL.

The split is enforced — there are no cross-imports from `engine/` to `tools/` or `assets/` — so the platform/content boundary stays clean.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Target | What |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial tools** | ✅ Done | QR Code, Quote Card, Email Signature, Day Brief, Code Canvas, Countdown Timer, Color Palette, Brand Lockup, Bag Video, Chart Creator, Filter: Duotone, Meeting Planner — web shell live |
| **Enhance current tooling** | Mid 2026 ✅ Done  | Downloadable offline app (Tauri); additional employee and event tools; richer export pipeline (text-to-path stability, metadata, extra formats — see `plans.md`) |
| **Open source the engine** | Late 2026 ✅ Done  | Engine, shells, schemas, docs go public — not the branded tools/assets |
| **Device-to-device transfer** | ✅ Done | Portable `lolly-backup` bundle carries profile, saved sessions, uploaded images and prefs between any two installs — offline or online, no account. Forward-compatible, integrity-checked envelope (spec: `docs/data-transfer.md`) |
| **Establish formal tool roadmap** | Late 2026 | Customer reference kits, AI design ingest, GET/URL request mode |
| **On-device privacy utilities** | 🚧 In progress | Content-transform tools that process *your own* file locally (file in → clean file out), replacing exfiltration to single-purpose SaaS. **Done:** `file` input type + `exportFile` transform path + `privacy:"on-device"` conventions (no watermark/provenance) + **Strip Hidden Data** (JPEG/PNG/SVG/PDF metadata, PDF via the `host.pdf` bridge) and **Text Helper** (the on-device workbench for the everyday paste-into-a-website jobs — JSON format, JWT decode, Base64, URL encode/decode, SHA hashing, plus a Novelty group). **Next:** crop/resize, image convert/compress; then a `host.image` codec bridge (spec: `plans/exfiltration-app-content.md`) |
| **Design tokens (DTCG)** | 🚧 Colour shipped | Brand primitives as canonical [W3C Design Tokens (DTCG)](https://www.designtokens.org/TR/drafts/format/) — the format [Penpot imports/exports](https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/design-systems/design-tokens/). **Done:** colour tokens (`suse/tokens/brand`), `host.tokens` bridge, picker swatches + reference-linked values (spec: `docs/design-tokens.md`). **Next:** dimension/type tokens, Penpot import/export, user tokens in the transfer bundle (`tokens.json`) |
| **MCP agent endpoint (render)** | ✅ Done | An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposes the catalogue + render path as callable tools (`lolly_list_tools` / `describe_tool` / `build_url` / `render` / `transform`) so any agent can produce on-brand assets — add it to any MCP client as a custom connector (OAuth 2.1) or point a CLI/HTTP client at it with a bearer token. Live at `mcp.lolly.tools` (full endpoint: raster/PDF/animation/video via a hosted headless browser) and `lolly.tools/api/mcp` (serverless browser-free tier). Distinct from the Penpot *authoring* MCP below, which is about tool **creation** (spec: `plans/mcp-server.md`; guide: `docs/mcp.md` + `docs/ai-agents.md`) |
| **Penpot file ingest as tools** | 2027+ | Import a Penpot file and surface it *as a Lolly tool* (declarative, constraint-first), turning designs authored in Penpot into deterministic, on-brand generators |
| **MCP + Penpot extension (online-only authoring)** | 2027+ | A Penpot MCP server articulates new tools with AI — the most visual way to create deterministic templates: a brand-informed first round, perfected with a human in the loop, targeting one-shot new contexts over time. Tool *creation* is online-only; the tools it produces run anywhere |
| **RBAC + SUSE ID** | 2027+ | Gate specific tools behind SUSE ID; multi-device saved state; Google Drive ingest/export |

## Where the engine ends and the host begins

If you can describe it in pure data + Handlebars → **engine**.
If it touches the DOM, filesystem, network, or any browser/OS API → **host**.

The line is sharp on purpose. The engine is the open-source part. Everything that knows about SUSE, specific platforms, or runtime environments stays out of it.

# Data Transfer — the `lolly-backup` bundle

Everything a Lolly user accumulates lives **on their device** — no account, no cloud. The data-transfer bundle is how that value moves: export it on one install, carry the file by any means (USB, AirDrop, email-to-self, a network share), and import it on another. The file *is* the transport. The target can be offline or online; it makes no difference, because nothing ever talks to a server.

This page is the format spec. For the end-user walkthrough see [Using Lolly → Moving to another device](/info/using.html); the implementation is [`shells/web/src/data-transfer.ts`](../shells/web/src/data-transfer.ts) with the round-trip contract pinned by [`tests/data-transfer.test.ts`](../tests/data-transfer.test.ts).

> **Scope.** A bundle carries *user data*, not tools. Tools and catalog assets are synced separately and are assumed to already be present on the target (worst case at a higher version). Importing never installs or upgrades a tool.

## Goals

- **One format, every shell.** The same bytes are produced and consumed by the web PWA, the Tauri desktop/mobile apps, and any future shell. The bundle is the contract; each shell's capability bridge is the per-platform adapter behind it.
- **Survives the trip.** A bundle mangled or truncated in transit fails loudly on import, never half-restores.
- **Outlives this version.** An older app can still import a newer bundle's recognised parts; a genuinely breaking format is refused cleanly.
- **Safe to merge.** Importing onto an install that's already in use never wipes anything that wasn't in the bundle.

## The envelope

A bundle is a plain `.zip`. The download is named for the person it belongs to — `LollyTools-<First>-<Last>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<n>.zip` (e.g. `LollyTools-Ada-Lovelace-2026-06-26-1.zip`) — so a Downloads folder of backups stays legible. The first/last parts come from the profile and are omitted when unset (no profile → `LollyTools-2026-06-26-1.zip`; first name only → `LollyTools-Ada-2026-06-26-1.zip`); each is sanitised to a filename-safe token (Unicode letters/digits kept, spaces/punctuation stripped, capped at 32 chars). `<n>` is a per-day, per-device sequence so repeat exports on the same day don't collide and stay in order. The name is built by `backupFilename()` in [`shells/web/src/data-transfer.ts`](../shells/web/src/data-transfer.ts); the zip's contents are identical regardless of name. Inside:

| Path | Required | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | yes | Format id, versions, counts, and per-part integrity. The first thing a reader looks at. |
| `profile.json` | when set | The user's `me` record (name, contact, headshot ref, flags). Read via `host.profile`. |
| `sessions.json` | yes | Every saved session: slot, tool id/version, label, thumbnail (data-URL), and full input data. Read via `host.state`. |
| `assets.json` | yes | Metadata for each uploaded image, each pointing at its bytes under `assets/blobs/`. |
| `assets/blobs/<n>.<ext>` | per image | The raw image bytes. Stored uncompressed (already-compressed formats). The extension is cosmetic; the MIME in `assets.json` is authoritative. |
| `prefs.json` | yes | User-owned local preferences: `theme`, `sidebarWidth`, and the `ct-metrics` activity tally. |

Being a plain zip is deliberate: it survives any transport intact and can be inspected with any unzip tool.

## `manifest.json`

```json
{
  "format": "lolly-backup",
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "minReader": 1,
  "app": "lolly",
  "exportedAt": "2026-06-22T09:30:00.000Z",
  "counts": { "profile": true, "sessions": 2, "userAssets": 4, "prefs": 3 },
  "integrity": {
    "profile.json": "sha256-…",
    "sessions.json": "sha256-…",
    "assets.json": "sha256-…",
    "assets/blobs/0.webp": "sha256-…",
    "prefs.json": "sha256-…"
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `format` | Always `lolly-backup`. A file without it is rejected as "not a Lolly backup". |
| `formatVersion` | The layout this bundle was **written** with. Bumped on any change to the part set or shapes. Readers do **not** gate on it. |
| `minReader` | The minimum reader version required to import this bundle **safely**. This is the field readers gate on. |
| `app` | Producing app id, for diagnostics. |
| `exportedAt` | ISO timestamp the bundle was created. |
| `counts` | What the writer put in, for display and sanity-checking. |
| `integrity` | Optional. Maps every part except `manifest.json` to an SRI-style `sha256-<base64>` digest of its **uncompressed** bytes. |

## Version policy (forward compatibility)

The split between `formatVersion` and `minReader` is what lets the format grow without orphaning older installs:

- A reader imports a bundle when `manifest.minReader ≤` its own reader version. It refuses (with "needs a newer version of the app") only when the bundle explicitly demands a newer reader.
- An **additive** change — a new *optional* part, or a new optional manifest field — bumps `formatVersion` but leaves `minReader` unchanged. Older apps still import every part they recognise; parts they don't are skipped (see below), not dropped silently.
- A **breaking** change — one where importing a part wrong would corrupt data, or where a previously optional part becomes mandatory — raises `minReader`. Older apps then refuse cleanly instead of importing something they'd mishandle.
- If a future bundle sets `formatVersion` but omits `minReader`, readers conservatively fall back to gating on `formatVersion` (treat the change as breaking).

> **Rule of thumb for authors:** if every existing reader would still do the right thing by ignoring your addition, it's additive — bump `formatVersion`, leave `minReader`. Otherwise raise `minReader`.

## Integrity

When `manifest.integrity` is present, a reader verifies each listed part's SHA-256 **before writing anything**. A mismatch ("failed its integrity check") or a missing part ("incomplete") aborts the whole import — there is no partial restore. This catches the corruption a file transport can introduce (a truncated AirDrop, an email gateway that re-encoded the attachment, a bad USB sector).

Integrity is best-effort by design: it's written only where Web Crypto is available (every secure browser context and modern Node), and verified only when both the map and Web Crypto are present. A bundle without the map — e.g. one from before integrity existed — imports unchanged. "Can't verify" is never treated as "corrupt".

The manifest never lists itself; the digests cover the parts the manifest vouches for.

## Import semantics

Import is **merge-overwrite**, never replace-all:

- Existing data on the target is left in place.
- Any key that collides — the profile, a session slot, an uploaded image id — is replaced by the imported copy.
- Nothing that wasn't in the bundle is touched. A session the target had but the bundle didn't survives the import.

Saved sessions re-link to their images automatically: asset references are kept by id, and the bridge re-resolves them after the uploaded images are restored (it must anyway, since `blob:` URLs don't survive a reload).

The import summary reports `{ profile, sessions, userAssets, prefs, skipped }`. `skipped` is the count of parts from a forward-compatible newer writer that this build didn't recognise — surfaced in the UI ("… · N newer items skipped") so the restore is honest about what it left behind.

## What does not travel

- **Catalog caches** (downloaded asset metadata and blobs, the tool index) — re-synced for free on the target.
- **Tools and brand assets** — out of scope; assumed already present on the target.
- **`blob:` / object URLs** — regenerated by the bridge on load.
- **The export sequence counter** — the per-day download-naming counter (`localStorage` key `lolly-export-seq`) is a local naming convenience, deliberately kept out of `PREF_KEYS` so it never rides in a bundle.

## Cross-shell guarantee

`data-transfer.ts` reads and writes exclusively through the capability bridge (`host.profile`, `host.state`, `host.assets`) and the shared `localStorage` prefs. Because the bridge is the only seam, the *same* module produces a byte-identical bundle on every shell even though the storage beneath differs — IndexedDB on web, the filesystem on Tauri. The Tauri shells reuse this module unchanged; only their `host.state` implementation differs. The headless test exercises the full round-trip against an in-memory bridge, which is why it stands in for all of them.

The Node CLI shell is intentionally excluded: its state is in-memory and ephemeral per invocation, so there is no accumulated user data to carry.

## Reserved extension points

The envelope is deliberately a manifest plus a set of named parts so that new kinds of portable data can ride it later **without a breaking change** — they slot in as additive parts (new `formatVersion`, same `minReader`), and today's reader skips what it doesn't recognise. These are on the [roadmap](/info/overview.html#roadmap), not yet implemented; the names are reserved here so the format stays coherent when they land.

- **`tokens.json` — design tokens.** A [W3C DTCG](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/) design-tokens document (the format [Penpot imports and exports](https://help.penpot.app/user-guide/design-systems/design-tokens/) — tokens with `$value`/`$type`/`$description`, organised into groups, sets, and themes). Carrying a token set in the bundle lets a user move their brand primitives between installs alongside their sessions. Longer term, an ingested token set becomes a first-class source that tools and palette assets resolve against.
- **`penpot/` — ingested Penpot files.** A reserved directory for a Penpot file (or its extracted, Lolly-relevant subset) imported and surfaced *as a tool*. The bundle would carry the ingested definition so it travels with the rest of the user's data.

Anything outside these reserved names and the parts above is, to a reader, an unknown part: left untouched and counted in `skipped`.

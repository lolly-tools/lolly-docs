# Contributing Setup

> **Scope.** This page is *how to get a development checkout sized to what you're here to do*. The [Build Guide](/info/build-guide.html) covers building each artefact once you have a checkout; this page is about which parts of the repo you actually need on disk, and the commands that pull down just those.

Lolly is a parent repo plus a set of git submodules (the full table is in the [Build Guide](/info/build-guide.html)). A complete recursive clone is the simple path and always works, but it downloads roughly 1.2 GB of git history before `npm install` adds a byte. Most contributions touch a fraction of that, so there is a slim path too.

---

## Why the repo is big

The working tree is modest; the weight is history:

| Where | History | Why |
|---|---|---|
| parent repo | ~490 MB | committed catalog images (tool previews, OG share cards) re-rendered over time |
| `docs/` | ~270 MB | screenshot baselines for every docs page, re-shot whenever the UI changes |
| `shells/web` | ~335 MB | the PWA's long history, fonts and binary assets included |
| everything else | ~60 MB | ordinary code history |

The tool definitions most contributors come to edit are 12 MB of history in `community/`.

Two things a fresh clone never downloads, whatever path you take: `brands/suse` (the private SUSE brand pack, marked `update = none` - public clones fall back to the neutral `lolly-start` profile and everything still builds) and `shells/web/public/models` (the on-device AI models are untracked local staging; the app fetches them on demand at runtime).

To build with the models bundled into your own `dist` instead of fetched at runtime, vendor them first with `npm run models:vendor` (~1.2 GB, opt-in - never run by install or CI). It downloads every family from its pinned upstream, verifies each file's hash before writing, and skips anything already present, so re-running only fetches what's missing (`--only=kokoro,matte` for a subset, `--list` to see the families). The files stay gitignored; nothing to commit.

## The full clone

The always-works path. On macOS and openSUSE, `./setup.sh` does everything after the clone - initialises every public submodule, installs git and Node if missing or too old, runs `npm install`, selects a content profile - and it is idempotent, so re-run it freely after a `git pull` or to repair a half-finished checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lolly-tools/lolly.git
cd lolly
./setup.sh
```

The classic form (`git clone --recurse-submodules … && npm install`) works identically if you'd rather manage the toolchain yourself. See the Build Guide's "Getting the source" for the script's flags (`--suse`, `--profile`, `--skip-node`), the SSH variant and putting each submodule on a branch. Budget about 1.2 GB of download and 2.6 GB on disk once `node_modules` is installed.

---

## The slim clone

Two commands replace the recursive clone:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/lolly-tools/lolly.git
cd lolly
scripts/subrepo/loldev setup tool-author   # or: engine-dev
npm install
```

`--filter=blob:none` makes the *parent* clone a [partial clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/partial-clone): you get the full commit history but file contents download only as they are needed. That drops the parent from ~490 MB to ~80 MB. The trade-off is that reading *old* file contents (`git log -p` on an old path, checking out an old commit) fetches from the network on demand, so deep history spelunking in the parent needs a connection. Day-to-day work on the current tree does not.

`loldev setup <persona>` then initialises only the submodules that persona needs, shallow (`--depth 1`) wherever presence is all that is required:

| Persona | Full history | Present but shallow | Skipped |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tool-author` | `community/` | `docs/`, `shells/web`, `shells/cli`, `shells/tui`, `services/mcp`, `services/ca` | `shells/tauri-desktop`, `shells/tauri-mobile`, `shells/chrome-extension` |
| `engine-dev` | `community/`, `shells/web`, `shells/cli` | `docs/`, `shells/tui`, `services/mcp`, `services/ca` | the same three |
| `full` | everything public | - | - |

Measured on a fresh clone (2026-08, rounded):

| | git objects downloaded | on disk before `npm install` | after `npm install` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tool-author` | ~170 MB | ~490 MB | ~1.6 GB |
| `engine-dev` | ~480 MB | ~800 MB | ~1.9 GB |
| full recursive clone | ~1.2 GB | ~1.5 GB | ~2.6 GB |

(`node_modules` is ~1.1 GB whichever way you clone; the slim paths save download and git weight, not npm weight.)

### Why shallow instead of skipped

npm workspaces resolve against a `package.json` in every workspace directory, and the repo's preinstall guard (`scripts/check-bootstrap.ts`) refuses to install into a checkout that is missing one - it also checks for `docs/` and `community/`, which the catalog and profile scripts need immediately after install. npm 10 fails outright on a missing workspace directory; npm 11 quietly skips it, which is worse, because `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` then silently lose that workspace's surface. So no persona *omits* a workspace: the ones you are not here to develop are checked out shallow, a full working tree at the recorded commit with one commit of history behind it. Only the two Tauri shells and the Chrome extension, which are neither workspaces nor guard sentinels, are skipped outright.

### What each persona can and cannot do

**`tool-author`** - you are writing or editing tools ([Authoring Tools](/info/authoring-tools.html)). Everything in the daily loop works: `npm run dev:web`, `npm run cli`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build:catalog` and `validate:catalog`, and the `/info` docs site builds (the docs *working tree* is present, only its history is shallow). `community/` has full history, so `git log` and `git blame` on a tool behave normally.

**`engine-dev`** - the same, plus full history in `shells/web` and `shells/cli`, the two shells you will be reading and bisecting when an engine change misbehaves. The engine itself (`engine/`), `packages/`, `schemas/` and `tests/` live in the parent repo, so every persona already has them.

**Neither slim persona** can build the desktop or mobile apps (no Tauri shells - `npm run typecheck:tauri` logs a skip, by design, rather than failing) or work on the Chrome extension. `git log`/`git blame` inside a shallow submodule see one commit until you deepen it (`git -C docs fetch --unshallow`).

**Committing from a slim clone** works normally - shallow clones can branch, commit and push. Submodules check out detached at the recorded commit, so put one on a branch before starting work in it (`git -C community checkout main`), exactly as the Build Guide describes for the full clone.

## Upgrading a slim clone

The personas are cumulative and re-runnable; nothing needs re-cloning:

```bash
scripts/subrepo/loldev setup engine-dev   # tool-author → engine-dev: deepens shells/web + shells/cli
scripts/subrepo/loldev setup full         # everything public, full history
```

`setup full` initialises whatever is missing and un-shallows whatever a slim setup left shallow, in place. It never moves the checked-out commit of a submodule you already have, so work in progress is safe. The parent stays a partial clone either way - that is a property of the original `git clone`, and it only shows when you read old blobs.

SUSE developers opt in to the private brand pack the same way they always have:

```bash
git submodule update --init --checkout brands/suse
npm run profile:suse
```

`loldev` runs in place from any checkout path (`scripts/subrepo/loldev`); set `LOLLY_ROOT` only if you keep multiple checkouts and want to point an installed copy at one of them.

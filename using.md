# Using Lolly

A practical guide to actually *using* the app — opening a tool, working the canvas, exporting, saving, and sharing. Everything here runs **on your device**: no account, no upload, no internet required after the first load.

> New here? [Getting Started](/info/getting-started.html) covers installing/deploying the app; this page is about driving it once it's open.

## Opening a tool

The home screen is the **gallery** — every tool, grouped by category. Click a card to open the tool; if you've worked on it before, a **Continue** button resumes your most recent session. Use the search box to filter by name.

Each tool is a split view: **controls** on one side, a live **preview** (the canvas) on the other. Change any control and the preview updates instantly.

> A few tools (like **Layout Studio**) instead open as a **free canvas** — a chromeless, direct-manipulation surface where you drag, resize, rotate and snap boxes of text, shapes and images, and double-click to edit text in place. It exports through the same render path as every other tool, so the canvas *is* the file. See [The free canvas](#the-free-canvas-layout-studio) below.

## The canvas (preview)

The preview always shows exactly what will export.

**Desktop**

- **Zoom:** Cmd/Ctrl-scroll, or pinch on a trackpad — zoom centres on your pointer.
- **Pan:** hold **Space** and drag, or drag with the **middle mouse button**. (Plain clicks stay free for clicking parts of the design.)
- **Keyboard:** `0` = fit to window · `1` = 100% · `+` / `−` = zoom.
- **Zoom HUD:** the small `−  NN%  +  Fit` control in the corner. Click the percentage to toggle Fit ↔ 100%.

**Touch**

- **Pinch** to zoom, **drag** to pan, **double-tap** to reset to fit.

**Click to jump to a control:** click any element in the design and the matching sidebar input gets focus and scrolls into view — for a repeating row group it folds open the exact row you clicked, so editing what you see is one tap away.

A dimension change always snaps the view back to a clean fit.

### The free canvas (Layout Studio)

Free-canvas tools add a working surface *around* the artboard, like a designer's pasteboard:

- **Off-canvas staging.** Drag a box past the frame edge and it stays fully **visible and selectable** — park elements off to the side while you arrange the composition, then drag them back in. Everything outside the frame is **gently faded** so the export area always reads at a glance, and the frame keeps its shadow to mark exactly where the file begins.
- **Only the frame exports.** The exported file is bounded by the artboard — anything left outside (or the part of a box hanging over the edge) is simply cropped out of the output, in raster and vector formats alike.
- **Zoom out past Fit** (down to 20%) to see the whole pasteboard when you've staged things far outside the frame.
- **Resizable artboard.** Changing the export dimensions resizes the frame in place; boxes keep their positions, so you can reframe a layout around existing content.

## On a phone

On narrow screens the layout reflows to one column:

- The **controls become a sheet** at the top with a **drag grip** on its lower edge. Drag the grip to resize it — it snaps to **peek / half / full** — or **tap** the grip to toggle collapsed ↔ expanded. The preview fills the space below and stays visible while you edit.
- A floating **Render** button opens the **Export** sheet — all the format, size, copy, save, and download controls in one place. Dismiss it by tapping the backdrop.

## Controls (inputs)

Tools expose only the inputs that are meant to vary — everything else (brand colours, layout, typography) is locked in by the tool author, so whatever you make is on-brand by construction. Inputs include text, sliders, colour pickers, dropdowns, dates, image pickers, and repeating row groups. Some are grouped under collapsible sections.

**Reset:** *Clear changes* returns every input to its defaults.

## Your details & headshot

**Profile** (top-right of the gallery) holds your name, contact details, and an optional **headshot**. Tools that ask for those fields pre-fill them automatically — set them once and your email signature, lockups, and badges fill themselves in. You can still override any field per session. Opt in with **Use my details** so a tool may read them.

Your headshot and details live **only on this device**. A profile can be more than just you — a team or a role you step into now and then. See **[Profiles](/info/profile.html)** for the full picture, including keeping more than one.

## Saving & continuing

Click **Save** to store the current inputs as a session for that tool. You can keep multiple named sessions per tool; each tool's **Continue** button reopens your most recent, and the **history button** (top-right, beside your profile) lists every saved session across all tools. Sessions are device-local. To organise them, open **Projects** (below).

## Projects

**Projects** — open it from the **Projects** tab beside **Tools**, or from **Profile → Storage → Organise in Projects** — is a home for everything you've saved, and it works like a file manager:

- **Folders that nest.** Group saved sessions into folders, and folders inside folders, as deep as you like. Create a folder, rename it, or drag a tile onto another folder to move it; a breadcrumb walks you back up. An always-present **Uncategorised** folder holds anything not yet filed.
- **File new work straight in.** Inside a folder, **+ New tool** opens a tool and files its first save into that folder automatically.
- **Multi-select (desktop).** Tick a tile's checkbox, drag a selection box across empty canvas, or **Shift/Cmd-click**; **right-click** a tile for its context menu. Then act on the whole selection at once.
- **Render a whole folder or selection.** **Render folder** exports every saved session in a folder — including its sub-folders — as one nested `.zip`. **Render selection** does the same for any multi-selection, and a single session renders straight to its own file. No Batch/Pro needed.
- **Share a saved session.** Right-click a session → **Share link** to copy a link that reopens it with the exact same inputs (the full Share dialog — see below).

## Sharing a link

Every input is captured in the page URL, so a link *is* the design. Use **Share** in the export controls — or **Share link** on any saved session in Projects — to open the **Share dialog**: a ready-to-copy link plus toggles for what happens when it's opened (fullscreen, the export panel expanded, download-on-open with `&export`, or copy-to-clipboard with `&copy`). A big design would make a long URL, so the dialog also offers a **Shortest link** that packs the whole state into a compact token — the readable form is always there too. Paste it to a colleague, bookmark it, or commit it. (Full details: [URL Mode](/info/url-mode.html).)

> Images you uploaded from your device are **not** included in a shared link — they only exist on your machine.

## Live camera (motion-reactive tools)

The photo **Filters** — Halftone, Scanline, Posterize, Duotone — show a **Go live** button where a camera is available. Turn it on and the effect tracks your webcam frame by frame, so it reacts to movement; you can record the result to GIF, WebM or MP4. Frames are read and processed **on your device** and never leave it, and the camera is released the moment you stop or leave the tool. (Any image picker also has **Take a photo** to grab a single frame as an on-device image.)

## My images

When a tool lets you add an image from your device, it's downscaled, stripped of EXIF/GPS, and saved to your personal **My images** library (under **Profile → Storage**). Reuse it across any tool. The library is capped and entirely local — manage or delete images there.

## Sound & accessibility

Lolly aims to be comfortable to use for everyone. The interface is keyboard-navigable, custom controls carry proper labels for screen readers, and every tool's live preview is exposed as a single labelled image describing what it's making.

A gentle layer of **assistive sounds** confirms what you do — arriving in the gallery, a valid vs. invalid Content Credentials check, closing a panel, switching a filter. It's **on by default** but always optional: toggle **Sound** off anywhere the switch appears (each view's options popover, or **Profile**), and the choice is remembered.

Beside that switch is **Neurospicy Mode** — an optional, calming background focus beat that loops quietly while you work. Pick a loop from the pill-shaped selector, play or pause it with the button beside it, and set its volume; it's **off by default** and, like Sound, is remembered across sessions and devices. Turning Sound off mutes the focus loop too.

## Storage & privacy

Everything is stored in your browser's local database (IndexedDB): your profile, saved sessions, uploaded images, and a cache of downloaded catalog content. **Profile → Storage** shows usage and lets you:

- **Clear cache** — drop downloaded catalog content (re-syncs next load).
- **Clear all my data** — wipe profile, sessions, and images. *Cannot be undone.*

Nothing is transmitted anywhere. No telemetry, no cloud rendering.

## Moving to another device

Because everything lives on your device, **Profile → Storage → Move to another device** lets you carry it all to a second install — no account, no cloud:

- **Export my data** downloads a single `LollyTools-<First>-<Last>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<n>.zip` (the name parts come from your profile and are dropped if unset; `<n>` is a per-day counter so same-day exports don't collide) containing your profile, every saved session (with its thumbnail), your uploaded images, and your preferences (theme, sidebar width, local activity stats).
- **Import data…** on the other install reads that file back in. It **merges**: anything with the same name (your profile, a session slot, an image) is replaced by the imported copy; everything else on that device is kept. Saved sessions re-link to your imported images automatically.

The catalog cache isn't included — it re-downloads itself on the new device. The bundle is a plain zip (`manifest.json` + `profile.json` + `sessions.json` + `assets.json` + `assets/blobs/…` + `prefs.json`, format id `lolly-backup`), so it survives email, USB, or AirDrop intact and is the same format every shell reads. Each part is checksummed, so a file damaged in transit is caught on import rather than restored half-broken. (Full format spec: [Data Transfer](/info/data-transfer.html).)

## Importing a design (Figma, Penpot, Illustrator, InDesign)

You can bring an existing design into Lolly and keep working on it: open **Layout Studio**, click **Import a design** in the canvas toolbar, and choose a Figma **.fig** or SVG, a Penpot **.penpot**, an Illustrator **.ai** / **.pdf**, or an InDesign **.idml**. Layers become editable boxes on the free canvas — text stays retypable, images land in **My images**, and type and colours conform to the brand globals — then the result saves, shares and renders like any other session. The parse happens entirely on your device. Full detail: **[Import a design](/info/design-import.html)**.

## Exporting

See **[Exporting & Formats](/info/exporting.html)** for the full story — choosing a format, output size and print units, transparency, video, and copy/share. In short: pick a format, set the size if you need to, and **Download** (or **Copy** to the clipboard).

## Batch (Pro) mode

For power users, **Batch** (linked from the gallery, gated behind the Pro feature flag, which defaults on) renders many variations at once — a grid where each row is a set of inputs, exported together. Ideal for localising a card into a dozen languages or generating every size variant in one pass. Fill rows by typing, pasting straight from a spreadsheet, or importing a CSV (you can export one back too), and set per-row format, size, and output filename. Save a whole grid as a named **batch session** that reopens from the gallery, and download every row as a single `.zip`.

Batch is for generating **many variants of one template** at once. To re-render sessions you've **already saved**, use **Projects → Render folder / Render selection** (above) — no Pro needed.

## Offline & install

Lolly is a PWA. After the first load it works **offline** — install it from your browser's address bar (or *Add to Home Screen* on mobile) for an app-like, full-screen experience. It updates itself when you're back online.

/**
 * The docs "Listen to this page" player - Phase 2c: migrated onto the shared
 * @lolly-tools/audio-dock shell, so the published /info docs use the SAME dock
 * component as the app (one component everywhere).
 *
 * This file is now a thin ENTRY POINT: it owns the singleton lifecycle (a second
 * Listen press focuses the open dock, never stacks a twin) and hands the shell a
 * dependency-free narration `DockHost` (docs/player/narration-host.ts) that ports
 * the old player's logic - audio-index.json resolution, cues/markdown-twin
 * follow-along, speed, cross-page playlist, Media Session. The shell renders the
 * whole dock (transport, scrub, caption, Follow-along, Speed, the AI disclosure)
 * and draws its OWN built-in 2D frequency backdrop from the host's analyser tap - 
 * so the /info bundle never pulls in butterchurn.
 *
 * ISOLATION (hard constraint): /info is a SEPARATE document that must NOT import
 * the SPA module graph. audio-dock is the only shared dependency, imported by a
 * RELATIVE path (`../../packages/audio-dock/src/index.ts`) - the same way
 * docs/build.ts imports `../packages/docs-render` - and esbuild-bundled into
 * /info/docs-player.js by docs/build.ts's bundleDocsPlayer. The shell is
 * dependency-free by design, so it bundles cleanly; nothing here reaches into
 * shells/web.
 *
 * Delivered as /info/docs-player.js, imported lazily on the first press of a
 * page's Listen button (or on arrival, when the previous page's auto-advance left
 * a hand-off in sessionStorage - see docs/build.ts's LISTEN_SCRIPT).

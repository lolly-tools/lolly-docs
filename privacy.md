# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: 11 August 2026*

> **In plain terms.** The documents, images, videos and files you make in Lolly stay

## What this policy covers

Lolly is open-source software - an engine, several app shells (web, desktop,
mobile, CLI), and a browser extension - that anyone can run. This policy has two
parts:

- <!--i:code--> **The software itself**: what it does and doesn't do with your data, wherever it
  runs. This is a property of the code, so it's true of every Lolly deployment,
  ours or anyone else's.
- <!--i:server--> **lolly.tools**, the reference deployment SUSE operates: the specific choices
  made running its optional server-side pieces (what's logged, for how long, by
  whom).

If you're using a self-hosted or enterprise Lolly instance, the software behaviour
below still applies, but the *operator* of that instance - not SUSE - is
responsible for anything server-side: their render endpoint, their MCP server,
their Content Credentials certificate authority, if they run one. Ask them for
their own policy. See [Adoption & Governance](/info/adoption-governance.html) for
what operating Lolly involves.

## The app: what stays on your device

Lolly's web, desktop and mobile shells run the entire render engine client-side.
Opening a tool, filling in inputs, previewing and exporting all happen on your
device - no server is involved, and the app works offline once loaded.

**The app sets no cookies.** To function, it keeps a small amount of data **on
your device only**, never transmitted:

- <!--i:sliders--> **Interface preferences** - theme, language, sound settings, sidebar/zoom
  sizing, sort and view choices, which onboarding tips you've seen - in
  `localStorage`, so they're available before the app has finished booting.
- <!--i:download--> **An offline cache of the tool catalogue and asset previews**, so the gallery
  works without a connection.
- <!--i:hash--> **Local usage counters** for your profile card's stats (how many exports, which
  tools) - a small bounded blob in `localStorage`, never read by us, never sent
  anywhere.
- <!--i:folder--> **Your own documents, saved sessions, uploaded assets and fonts** - stored in
  IndexedDB on your device, never uploaded, never read by anyone but you.

None of this is shared, sold, or used to identify or track you. There is nothing
to consent to, because there is no collection happening - only this notice, so you
know what's kept and where. Wipe all of it at any time with **Profile → Clear all
my data**, or by clearing the site's storage in your browser. (Under the ePrivacy
Directive Art. 5(3), storage that is strictly necessary for the service you asked
for doesn't require consent - only transparency, which is what this document and
the in-app notice both are.)

![The storage section of the profile page on a phone-width screen: every category of on-device data named, with the Clear all my data button right beside it](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Fprofile%3Ffocus%3Dstorage-section&width=430&height=1600&dpi=192&waitMs=2400&css=.welcome-dialog%2C.personalize-nudge%2C.store-manages%2C.storage-subsection%2C.store-selbar%2C.store-chip-val%2C%23store-hero-num%2C%23store-headroom%2C%23store-quota%2C%23store-reclaim%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&format=svg&walker=1&cropSelector=%23storage-section&dark=1&filename=pv-storage-clear)

Your own backup of this data - the `lolly-backup` bundle produced by **Export my
data & render everything** - is a file you keep and control. It never touches our
servers unless you choose to send it somewhere yourself. See [Data
Transfer](/info/data-transfer.html).

## On-device utilities

Some tools - **Strip Hidden Data**, **Compress PDF**, and others carrying the
**"Runs on your device"** badge - operate on a file you provide. The file is read
into memory in your browser, transformed locally, and offered back as a download.
It is never uploaded, because there is no server in the path to upload it to.
These utilities work offline, and their output carries no watermark or metadata of
ours - the point of most of them is to remove & protect data, not add risk.

![The badge these tools carry: Runs on your device - nothing is uploaded](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Ftool%2Fstrip-data&width=1440&height=900&dpi=192&waitMs=2400&walker=1&format=svg&cropSelector=.on-device-badge&dark=1&filename=pv-ondevice-badge)

## When the app talks to a network, in full

The table below is the complete list of everything the app fetches or sends over a
network. If it isn't here, the app doesn't do it.

| What | What actually leaves your device | When |
|---|---|---|
| Tool catalogue sync | Nothing personal - a request for Lolly's own public tool and asset index | On startup, then cached offline |
| A tool that needs live data | Whatever that specific tool requests, to the host named in its own description. Today that is only the city lookup in the Meeting Planner tool, which asks `geocoding-api.open-meteo.com` to turn a city name into coordinates and a time zone - no account, no key, and no identifier beyond the request itself. The input says so right where you type, and each answer is saved on your device so a city is looked up once | Only while using that tool, and only once you enter a location |
| Google Fonts | The chosen font family name and your IP address, to Google's font servers (`fonts.googleapis.com` for the stylesheet, `fonts.gstatic.com` for the font file) | Only if you add a Google Font in the brand editor, **and only after you agree to it in a dialog that says exactly this** - a one-time fetch per family, then it lives on your device and is used offline |
| ICC press profiles | Nothing personal - a request for a standard printing-condition profile, to the ICC's public registry (`registry.color.org`, `www.color.org`) | Only if you click an ICC preset in the print-profile manager - a one-time fetch per profile, then it lives on your device |
| Internet radio | Nothing personal - a playlist request and an audio stream, to the station (`api.somafm.com` and the icecast server it names, `*.somafm.com`) | Only while you play the optional built-in radio in the sound player |
| SEAL signature check | **Nothing.** The web app has no DNS resolver at all - see below | Never |
| Deep-scan detector models | Nothing personal - a one-time same-origin model download (not a third party) | Only if you opt into Verify's deep scan |
| Remote instance | Whatever the instance you name serves back, over the same catalogue sync described above | Only if you explicitly point the shell at another Lolly deployment |

Every host in that table is also the complete allowlist in the app's
Content-Security-Policy, which the browser enforces. So the list is not only a
description of what the code does today, it is the boundary the browser holds the
app to: a future change that tried to contact some other host would be blocked,
not silently permitted. A deployment that wants none of the optional ones (an
enterprise instance with its own fonts, say) removes those hosts from its policy
and the features fail closed rather than reaching out.

None of these send your documents, projects, sessions or uploaded files anywhere.
They exist to bring things *to* your device (tools, fonts, models), never to send
things *from* it, with the exceptions named explicitly in the sections below.

**A note on what we removed.** Verify can check SEAL signatures, a scheme where a
file's signing key is published in DNS. Browsers can't make DNS queries, so any
web implementation has to route the lookup through a third-party DNS-over-HTTPS
resolver - which would show that operator the domain being checked plus your IP
address. We used to use Cloudflare's. **We don't any more, and there is no
replacement**: the web app now passes no resolver at all, so SEAL verification
here makes zero network requests. Files whose SEAL record carries its key inline
still verify completely offline. Files whose key lives in DNS report "no key
resolver" instead, and you can check those in the desktop or command-line app,
which resolve DNS natively through your own machine with no third party
involved.

![The Verify screen: a drop target and nothing else - the file is checked where it already is, with no upload and no account](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Fverify&width=1440&height=900&dpi=192&waitMs=1400&walker=1&format=svg&cropSelector=.valid-layout&dark=1&filename=cc-verify-drop) You can confirm this yourself: greppable checks for this and every
other claim on this page, with the exact commands and expected output, live at
[Verify It Yourself](/info/verify-yourself.html).

## Hot-linked render URLs

> **Currently switched off on lolly.tools.** Every
> `https://lolly.tools/tool/<tool-id>.<ext>` URL returns 404 today. The section
> below describes what the feature does when an operator enables it, and why we
> have not. It will be turned on here once the service moves to SUSE-operated
> infrastructure, and this notice will change when it is.

The app itself stays entirely on your device. Separately, an operator can enable
**hot-link render URLs** - `/tool/<tool-id>.<ext>?<inputs>` - so a shared Lolly
link can appear as a live image in a README, a wiki or a dashboard. Fetching one
asks the server to render **public tool and catalogue data** with the inputs
written into the URL.

- <!--i:usercheck--> **No accounts, no cookies, no state.** The endpoint is anonymous, and nothing
  on your device is read. Your documents, sessions and uploads never leave your
  browser - they cannot appear in these links at all.
- <!--i:document--> **But the URL itself is recorded.** A URL's query string is part of the request
  line, so it lands in the hosting platform's ordinary access logs the same way
  every requested path does. If a link's inputs contain someone's name or email -
  a name badge, an email signature - **that text sits in those logs**, and no
  amount of policy wording changes it. This is the specific reason the feature is
  off here rather than on.
- <!--i:globe--> **The inputs are public by construction** anyway - they are whatever the link's
  author typed into the URL, readable by anyone the link reaches. Don't put
  secrets in a shared link. Lolly offers link encryption for sensitive content.
- <!--i:eyeoff--> Responses are **cached and rate-limited** like any public image, and marked
  `noindex` so search engines don't index your renders.

Self-hosting Lolly and don't want a public render surface? Set
`LOLLY_DISABLE_RENDER_GET=1` - what lolly.tools itself currently does - and every
one of these URLs returns 404.

## The MCP server (optional, for AI agents)

Lolly can also be reached by an AI agent over the Model Context Protocol - an
operator-run endpoint (lolly.tools runs one; anyone can self-host their own,
including fully air-gapped). It shares the render path's no-accounts posture,
plus three tools that necessarily handle file bytes:

- <!--i:cpu--> **`lolly_transform`** (run an on-device utility server-side, on the calling
  agent's behalf), **`lolly_verify`** (check Content Credentials) and **`lolly_redact`**
  (black out regions of an image or PDF) all accept
  a file's bytes from the caller. They are processed **in-process, in memory**,
  and the result is returned in that same call - the file is never written to
  disk and never stored once the request completes.
- <!--i:checklist--> Every other tool - `lolly_render`, `lolly_build_url`, `lolly_list_tools`,
  `lolly_describe_tool` - works from parameters only (text, numbers, colours,
  URLs, catalogue asset ids), the same inputs a hot-link render URL takes.
- <!--i:lock--> Access is either a shared token the operator issues to clients they trust, or
  stateless OAuth 2.1: short-lived signed tokens verified against a shared
  secret, nothing stored server-side, and the token itself is never written to a
  log or a render URL.

## Content Credentials identity (a sign-in you have to start yourself)

Lolly can seal a cryptographic **Content Credential** into your exports so anyone
can verify, offline, that a file is unaltered since it left Lolly. That much is
**on by default and fully local** - the signing key is generated on your device
and signing itself happens offline. Without enrolment that key is a throwaway:
a fresh keypair minted for each export and dropped with it. Once you enrol, the
key becomes a lasting one and is generated **non-extractable** - not even Lolly's
own code can read it, only ask it to sign. Either way it never leaves your
device. This section covers the one *optional* step on top of that:
enrolling a verified identity, so your exports say "Verified - signed by
\<your email\>" instead of an anonymous key. **If you skip enrolment, nothing in
this section applies to you, and no personal data ever leaves your device.**

![The Verified identity card on the profile page, phone-width: the certificate lifetime picker and the enrolment step beneath it, dormant until you start it yourself](/t/url-shot?url=%2F%23%2Fprofile%3Ffocus%3Didentity-section&width=430&height=1600&dpi=192&waitMs=2400&css=.welcome-dialog%2C.personalize-nudge%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&format=svg&walker=1&cropSelector=%23identity-section&dark=1&filename=pv-identity-enrol)

If you do enrol, here is exactly what happens:

1. **You choose a sign-in method** - GitHub, Google, SUSE (id.suse.com), or an
   emailed link. For the three OIDC providers, you're redirected to that
   provider's own login page, governed by their privacy policy, not ours.
   Lolly's certificate service receives back only a verified email address and
   the provider's name. For the email link, the address you type is passed to
   **Resend**, a transactional email API, solely to deliver that one link.
2. **A short-lived cookie protects the redirect.** This is the one cookie the
   entire Lolly system sets: `lolly_ca_state`, `HttpOnly`, scoped to `/api/ca`,
   expiring within ten minutes. It carries a random value, not a tracking
   identifier, and exists only to stop the OAuth redirect being forged. It is
   cleared as soon as sign-in completes.
3. **Your IP address is used, briefly, to prevent abuse** of the sign-in
   endpoints (so one script can't spam an inbox or exhaust the email quota) - held
   in server memory only, for a sliding window of about a minute, never written
   to a log or persisted anywhere.
4. **The certificate service issues a short-lived certificate** (7, 30, 90 or 365
   days, your choice, capped by the operator's policy) binding your verified
   email to the public half of the keypair generated on your device. The private
   half never leaves your browser.
5. **Nothing about the issuance is recorded.** The certificate service keeps no
   issuance log: not your email, not the provider, not a serial number, not a
   timestamp. No database, no log line, no webhook. Your email address exists in
   the request only long enough to be written into the certificate that your own
   device receives, and then it is gone from our side entirely.
6. **After that, signing is offline again** for the certificate's whole lifetime.
   Exporting a file never contacts the certificate service - only enrolling did.

**The tradeoff, stated plainly.** An earlier version of this service did log each
issuance, so that a misissued or compromised certificate could be traced. We
removed it, because that log was the only place in all of Lolly where personal
data came to rest on a server, and we would rather not hold it than hold it
carefully. What we give up is server-side traceability: if a certificate is
misused we cannot look up who obtained it. Certificates are short-lived by
design - 7 to 365 days, your choice, capped by the operator - and expire on their
own, which is the mitigation we rely on instead. Self-hosters whose own
obligations require an audit log can add one, and become the controller of that
data by doing so.

## The browser extension

The **Lolly URL Screenshot** browser extension does not collect, store, or
transmit any personal data. No analytics, no tracking, no remote server.

**What it does.** When you ask the Lolly web app to screenshot a URL, the
extension opens that page in a temporary background tab, captures it in your
browser using the DevTools Protocol, hands the image back to the app, and closes
the tab. Everything happens locally, on your own device and network.

**Data.**

- <!--i:shieldcheck--> **We collect nothing.** The extension has no servers and makes no network
  requests of its own.
- <!--i:photos--> **Captured images** go straight to the Lolly app in the same browser - never
  uploaded by the extension.
- <!--i:link--> **The URLs you capture** are used only to load that one page for that one
  screenshot. They are not logged or shared.

**Permissions.**

- <!--i:wrench--> **`debugger`** - to capture the rendered page via the DevTools Protocol (the
  same mechanism the Lolly desktop app uses).
- <!--i:monitor--> **`tabs`** - to open and close the temporary tab the page loads in.
- <!--i:globe--> **Host access (`<all_urls>`)** - because the page you choose to capture can be
  on any site. Chrome surfaces this at install time as a broad permission
  warning. The extension only ever visits the URL you give it.

None of these are used to read, monitor, or transmit your browsing beyond that
one requested capture.

## Infrastructure logs

Like any website, the servers behind lolly.tools - and behind any Lolly
deployment - generate standard web-server access logs whenever a request reaches
them at all: IP address, requested path, timestamp, user agent. That's baseline
hosting behaviour, not something Lolly adds on top, and it never contains the
contents of your documents, because those never reach a server to begin with. The
one deliberate exception is a file you explicitly hand to an MCP
`lolly_transform`, `lolly_verify` or `lolly_redact` call, which is processed in memory and never
written to disk or a log, as described above.

**Lolly's own code writes nothing to those logs.** The MCP server contains no
logging statements at all. The certificate service emits exactly two lines, both
on failure and both deliberately stripped: a send-failure status code with no
recipient address, and an error message with no stack trace or URL (a stack could
carry an enrolment token). Everything else in the log is the hosting platform's,
not ours.

For lolly.tools, hosting is Vercel and access-log retention follows Vercel's own
platform defaults for our plan. We configure no log drain, no long-term log
export, and no analytics or monitoring product on top. We keep no copy of these
logs ourselves, which also means we have no way to search them for you - see
[Your rights](#your-rights).

## Legal bases, retention and recipients

Almost nothing here needs a legal basis, because almost nothing is processed. For
completeness, the entire list:

| Processing | Legal basis (GDPR Art. 6) | Retained for |
|---|---|---|
| Everything on your device (documents, prefs, cache, counters) | **Not our processing at all** - it never reaches us. Storage on your device is strictly necessary for the service you requested (ePrivacy Art. 5(3)), so it needs no consent | Until you delete it |
| Your email address during Content Credentials enrolment | **Art. 6(1)(b)**, performance of a service you explicitly requested | Not retained. Present in memory for the duration of the request only |
| Your IP address on the sign-in endpoints, for rate limiting | **Art. 6(1)(f)**, our legitimate interest in preventing abuse of a free service and of a third party's email quota. We consider this to pass a balancing test because it is in memory only, never written down, and discarded within about a minute | ~1 minute, in server memory, never persisted |
| Hosting access logs (IP, path, timestamp, user agent) | **Art. 6(1)(f)**, our legitimate interest in service security, abuse prevention and diagnosing faults | Vercel's platform default for our plan. We add no drain or export |

**Recipients.** The categories of recipient are: our hosting provider (Vercel
Inc.), and - only if you use the email sign-in option - a transactional email
provider (Resend). If you sign in with GitHub, Google or SUSE (id.suse.com), you
interact with that provider directly under their own privacy policy. They tell
us a verified email address and nothing else. We share personal data with no one
else, and we do not sell data, run advertising, or profile users.

**Transfers outside the EEA.** Vercel and Resend are US companies. Function
compute for lolly.tools is pinned to Vercel's Frankfurt (`fra1`) region so
processing happens in the EU, but as US-headquartered providers they may still
access data as processors from the US. Those transfers rely on the European
Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses and/or the EU-US Data Privacy
Framework, as set out in each provider's data processing agreement. Because the
personal data reaching either provider is so limited - an email address passed
through to send one message, and ordinary access logs - the exposure is
correspondingly small.

**Automated decision-making.** None. There is no profiling and no automated
decision producing legal or similarly significant effects (Art. 22).

## Children's privacy

Lolly does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, of any age, in
the ordinary course of using the app - there is nothing to collect. The one place
personal information (an email address) is ever gathered is Content Credentials
enrolment, described above, which is not directed at or intended for children.

## Your rights

Because almost everything Lolly touches is stored only on your own device, most of
what data-protection law calls "your rights" - access, correction, deletion,
portability - are things you can already do yourself, instantly, without asking
anyone: your data lives in your browser's storage, in a form you can inspect,
export (**Export my data & render everything**, above), or delete (**Profile → Clear all
my data**).

Formally, under GDPR Articles 15-22 you have the right to **access** your
personal data, to **rectify** it, to **erase** it, to **restrict** or **object
to** its processing (including objecting to anything we base on legitimate
interests), to **data portability**, and - where processing rests on consent - to
**withdraw that consent at any time**, without affecting the lawfulness of what
happened before you withdrew it.

Here is the honest position on exercising them against us. Since we no longer
keep an issuance log, **we hold no personal data about you that we can look up,
correct, export or delete.** If you write and ask what we have on you, the
truthful answer is nothing, and we will say so. The one category that exists at
all is hosting access logs keyed to an IP address, held by our hosting provider
under their retention defaults. We have no facility to search or selectively
delete those, and we will tell you that rather than pretend otherwise. Everything
that is actually *yours* is on your device, where you can already read, export
and destroy it without asking anyone's permission.

**You have the right to complain.** If you think we have handled your data
improperly, you can lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory
authority - in the EU, the authority in your country of residence, place of work,
or where you believe the infringement occurred (Art. 77). Our lead supervisory
authority is the *Bayerisches Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht* (BayLDA) in
Ansbach, Germany. You do not need to contact us first, though we would like the
chance to fix it.

We don't sell data. We don't have any to sell.

## Changes to this policy

The date at the top changes whenever this document does. A change that alters
what leaves your device or what's retained gets its own line here, not a silent
edit - if you want to see what changed, ask (below) or compare against the
[public source](https://github.com/lolly-tools/lolly/commits/main/docs/privacy.md).

## Who is responsible, and how to reach us

The **data controller** for lolly.tools is:

> SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH
> Frankenstraße 146
> 90461 Nürnberg
> Germany

SUSE has appointed a **Data Protection Officer**, reachable at
[privacy@suse.com](mailto:privacy@suse.com). Use that address for any formal
request under "Your rights" above.

For anything about Lolly itself - how it works, why a thing is the way it is, or
a correction to this document - contact **Andy Fitzsimon**,
[fitzy@suse.com](mailto:fitzy@suse.com).

For a self-hosted or enterprise Lolly instance, contact whoever operates it
instead: the operator is the controller for their own deployment. SUSE and the
Lolly open source project hold no data for deployments they don't run.

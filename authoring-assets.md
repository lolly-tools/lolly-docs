# Authoring Assets

Assets are global, versioned, brand-controlled resources tools draw from. Logos and mascots, palettes, design tokens, event tiles, fonts, music beds, and video b-roll. The authoritative list of asset types is the `type` enum in `schemas/asset.schema.json`: `vector | raster | video | audio | lottie | palette | tokens | font`.

## Anatomy

```
catalog/assets/
├── index.json                                   # the manifest of all assets
└── <namespace>/<group>/<name>.<ext>             # the files themselves
```

Example:

```
catalog/assets/suse/logo/primary.svg
catalog/assets/suse/logo/primary.png
catalog/assets/suse/palette/brand-core.json
catalog/assets/event/kubecon-2026/badge.svg
```

## The asset entry (in `index.json`)

Validated against `schemas/asset.schema.json`.

```json
{
  "id": "suse/logo/primary",
  "name": "SUSE Primary Logo",
  "type": "vector",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tier": "core",
  "tags": ["logo", "official", "centermark"],
  "formats": [
    {
      "format": "svg",
      "url": "/catalog/assets/suse/logo/primary.svg",
      "checksum": "sha256-...",
      "size": 2048
    }
  ],
  "license": "internal"
}
```

## Rules that don't bend

- **`id` is forever.** Once published, never rename, never reuse. If you need a different logo, give it a different ID.
- **Bump `version` on every byte change.** Tools cache by id+version. Forgetting to bump means stale bytes everywhere.
- **Always include a `checksum`.** SRI-format SHA-256. End-to-end integrity check, prevents CDN poisoning.
- **Deprecate, don't delete.** Set `"deprecated": true` and optionally `"replacedBy": "new/asset/id"`. Existing references continue to resolve.

## Tiers

| Tier         | What it means                                                  | When to use |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `core`       | Bundled with the app. Always available offline.                | Logos, primary palette, design tokens, core mascot poses |
| `catalog`    | Synced at boot, cached. Available offline once cached.         | Most things — event packs, icon sets |
| `on-demand`  | Fetched when first used, then cached. Needs net first time.    | Heavy items — hi-res photo, video b-roll |

The `core` tier is meant to stay small (target a few dozen brand essentials) — most assets ride in the `catalog` and `on-demand` tiers. Catalog-tier entries can set `"prefetch": true` (catalog tier only) to fetch their bytes at sync time rather than lazily on first use.

## Locales

Locale-specific format variants go under `locales`:

```json
{
  "id": "suse/wordmark/horizontal",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tier": "core",
  "formats": [
    { "format": "svg", "url": "/catalog/assets/suse/wordmark/horizontal.svg", "checksum": "sha256-..." }
  ],
  "locales": {
    "ja": [
      { "format": "svg", "url": "/catalog/assets/suse/wordmark/horizontal-ja.svg", "checksum": "sha256-..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

Tools and host UI resolve via BCP-47 locale matching. Falls back to the base entry if no locale variant exists.

## Palettes

Palettes are a special asset type whose payload is JSON, not an image:

```json
{
  "name": "SUSE Brand Core",
  "swatches": [
    { "name": "Jungle", "hex": "#0C322C", "rgb": "...", "hsl": "..." },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Tools reference palette swatches through `host.assets.get(id)` → `ref.meta.swatches`. Note this is wired up in the **CLI shell** today (its bridge parses the palette JSON and spreads `swatches` into `meta`); the web shell's assets bridge does not yet populate `meta.swatches`, so don't rely on it cross-shell.

The `color` input type also accepts a `palette` field (schema-valid, mapped to a `palette-picker` control in `engine/src/inputs.ts`), but the web shell currently renders that control as a **stub**. For a working brand-restricted picker today, use a `color` input with `"swatchesOnly": true` — it renders the real brand swatch picker (no hex/native/alpha).

## Themable two-colour icons

An icon tagged `themable` is an SVG that expresses its two colours only as classes, with one overridable default block and nothing else — no other `fill`/`stroke`/`style` anywhere:

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40" width="40" height="40">
  <defs><style>.c1{fill:#30ba78}.c2{fill:#0c322c}</style></defs>
  <path class="c2" d="…"/>   <!-- base (majority) shapes -->
  <path class="c1" d="…"/>   <!-- accent shapes -->
</svg>
```

- `.c1` is the **accent**, `.c2` the **base**. The defaults (jungle on pine) are plain class rules, so inlining the SVG lets a page or tool override them — `.c1 { fill: … !important }` wins by design.
- The colour pairings the picker offers come from a palette-type asset tagged `icon-themes` (`suse/palette/icon-themes`); its first pairing must match the defaults baked into the icons.
- A non-default pairing chosen in the picker travels **inside the asset id** — `suse/icons/ai?theme=ocean` — because an asset value persists as its id alone (URL mode). Both shell bridges parse that suffix (`parseThemedAssetId`) and bake the pairing at resolve time (`applyIconTheme`: style block removed, fills inlined as attributes) so two differently-themed copies never fight over class rules inside one exported SVG/PDF.
- The validator enforces the contract for every `themable`-tagged SVG (exactly one default style block; classes limited to `c1`/`c2`; no inline styles or strokes).

## Design tokens

`type: "tokens"` is a DTCG (Design Tokens Community Group) JSON document — the canonical brand-color source. The core asset `suse/tokens/brand` feeds the color picker's swatches and the defaults for brand-bound inputs. Beyond the normal asset checks, the validator runs a dedicated DTCG-structure validation against `schemas/tokens.schema.json` (`scripts/validate-catalog.ts`). See [Design tokens](/info/design-tokens.html) for the token model and how palettes relate.

## Fonts

`font` is a valid asset type, but the shared SUSE typefaces don't live in the asset index — they ship as static files under `catalog/fonts/`, a sibling of `catalog/assets/`:

```
catalog/fonts/
├── variable/    # variable TTFs (SUSE[wght].ttf, SUSEMono[wght].ttf, + italic axes)
├── webfonts/    # woff2 — the variable fonts plus per-weight statics
├── ttf/         # static TTFs
└── otf/         # static OTFs
```

The web shell loads them via `@font-face` (`shells/web/src/styles/fonts.css`, with the variable woff2 preloaded from `index.html`); tool templates reference the same `/catalog/fonts/...` URLs directly. The text-to-path step (`host.text`, used when a vector export outlines its text) reads the static TTFs from `catalog/fonts/ttf/`. Because they're plain static files, they aren't versioned or checksummed through `index.json` the way catalog entries are.

## Workflow

1. Drop the file under `catalog/assets/<namespace>/...`.
2. Add an entry to `catalog/assets/index.json` (the `checksum`/`size` can be left
   as `sha256-PLACEHOLDER`/`0` — the next step fills them in).
3. Run `npm run build:catalog` — `scripts/checksum-assets.ts` computes the real
   SHA-256 (SRI) and byte size for every asset format and writes them into the
   index. `npm run validate:catalog` then verifies every checksum against the
   bytes on disk.
4. PR review. Approval = brand approval.
5. Merge → build catalog → deploy. Clients pick it up at next sync.

This git-reviewed flow is for a **shared, governed catalog** — the model where a whole organisation syncs one asset library and wants every change to carry PR review as brand approval. It's an *option for that case*, not how the app works day to day.

Most people never touch it: in the open app you **ingest your own creative files straight into your catalogue** — drag them onto the [Catalogue](/info/using.html) view or the Brand Studio's Catalogue tab, and they're instantly available in every tool's asset picker, on your device. Those user assets live under the `user/` namespace and never enter a shared catalog. The git route matters only when you're curating a library many people depend on.

Composed renders — a tool that embeds another tool's output via `composes` (see [Authoring tools](/info/authoring-tools.html)) — surface as ephemeral `AssetRef`s through the same `{{asset id}}` helper, but they are runtime intermediates, not catalog assets.

 * The credential line a screenshot carries: a photo-credit in the corner, except
 * the credit is checkable.
 *
 * Deliberately almost invisible. At rest it is one small imprint glyph at low
 * opacity - the same weight a photographer's byline carries in a magazine, which
 * readers are practised at skimming past. It only becomes words on hover, focus or
 * tap. Every shot on the site was made the same way, so a permanently visible line
 * on all 155 would be noise repeated 155 times; the people who go looking are the
 * people it convinces.
 *
 * The facts come from the file's own manifest (docs/shot-provenance.ts), never from
 * anything hardcoded here, and the two links act on the SERVED FILE:
 *   - verify   → #/verify?src=/info/shots/<file>, the shell's same-origin verify
 *                path, which fetches those bytes and checks them on the reader's
 *                machine. The site never marks its own homework.
 *   - download → the signed file itself, so the credential can be taken elsewhere
 *                (c2patool, Content Credentials Verify) and checked independently.
 *
 * A shot whose credential will not decode gets NO line, rather than a line that
 * implies more than the file can back up.
 *
 * The second row (paths, groups, embedded images, KB) is the same idea pointed at the
 * artwork rather than at its signature: it says what the file IS. Every one of these
 * screenshots is a vector document, and the corpus lost 50% of its weight moving from
 * the print path to the walker, so "134 paths, 484 KB" is the claim in numbers a reader
 * can check against the bytes they were served. Every pill is a property of those bytes
 * - the recipe's capture viewport is NOT here, because it describes the request rather
 * than the file and disagrees with the shipped artwork on most shots; it lives in the
 * accessible label as context instead. The row appears only in the expanded state,
 * which is the whole line's state - see the CSS - and the line is bottom-anchored so
 * its second row never moves the resting glyph.

/**
 * `::: showcase` - the one screenshot on the site that is INLINED as live SVG
 * rather than served through an <img>, so scroll can drive its real `viewBox`.
 *
 * Why this exists: Blink rasterises an SVG <img> at whatever scale it is
 * composited, so the moment you zoom or pan one it goes soft - the one thing the
 * docs most want to demonstrate (that these screenshots are geometry, not pixels)
 * is exactly the thing an <img> cannot show under motion. Animating a viewBox on
 * inlined SVG is a true camera move
 * over the geometry: nothing re-rasterises, and because the captured strokes carry
 * `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"`, they stay hairline at every zoom the way a
 * CAD viewer does. A bitmap cannot fake either property.
 *
 * PROVENANCE - the important part. Inlining takes the FILE off the page, and a
 * C2PA hash binding covers file bytes, not DOM. Two consequences, both handled:
 *
 *  1. The manifest is STRIPPED from the inlined copy. Left in, a reader who saved
 *     the inline markup out of devtools would hold a file whose credential fails to
 *     validate - a false negative on a genuine Lolly asset, which is worse than no
 *     credential at all.
 *  2. The signed file is still served at /info/shots/<slug>.svg and the credential
 *     line points at it, so "verify" and "download" both act on the real bytes.
 *     The inline copy is presentation; the file remains the record.
 *
 * WHY THE INLINING HAPPENS AT RUNTIME, not here. Emitting the SVG into the page
 * took exporting.html from 35 KB to 285 KB gzipped - a quarter-megabyte of
 * BLOCKING markup charged to every reader, scroll that far or not, neither lazily
 * loaded nor cacheable apart from the page. So the build emits the ordinary <img>
 * and SHOWCASE_SCRIPT swaps in live SVG when the block first approaches the
 * viewport. The file was going to be fetched anyway, so the motion costs no extra
 * bytes - and the geometry being animated is then literally the signed file's own,
 * parsed from the exact bytes the credential covers.
 *
 * With no JS the <img> simply stays: the finished artwork, no motion, no penalty.
 *
 * The block wraps an ordinary url-shot recipe line, so the shot pipeline
 * (scripts/build-docs-shots.ts, which regex-scans every docs page) still captures,
 * compares and credentials it exactly like the other 154.

 * shield + tick the web shell's Verify button and profile use, SITE_ICONS
 * .importPointShield here), and it opens the real /verify view with THIS file already
 * loaded: `#/verify?src=…` fetches a same-origin path and runs it through the normal
 * on-device check (shells/web/src/views/valid.ts). Nothing is re-signed and nothing is
 * swapped to make the demonstration work - it is the same bytes the page is serving.
 *
 * A corner overlay, sized in the same clamp() family as the logo so it stays a badge
 * at every width, and positioned at 82%/82% of the slot: the mark is a circle, so its
 * bottom-right diagonal edge (50% + 35.4%) is the one place a badge sits ON the
 * artwork rather than in the empty corner of its box. It is a real <a> with its own
 * accessible name - NOT nested inside the logo's link, which would be invalid and
 * would leave the badge unreachable by keyboard: a link's name is the text it
 * contains, so a badge in there would make the logo link read as "Open Lolly -
 * browse all tools Verify this logo's credentials". It is a sibling of the logo mark
 * inside .hero-logo-slot, which is the positioned box for both.

             viewBox is an attribute, not a CSS property). The captured strokes are
             non-scaling-stroke, so they stay hairline all the way in. No re-raster,
             no blur, at any zoom - the whole point of the block.
     ink     grayscale(1 - p): the drawing arrives as ink and takes on its colour.
             A filter function list CAN transition, unlike the url() case above.
     order   each leaf shape appears when p passes its share of the paint order, so
             the map assembles itself layer by layer (water, then road classes by
             weight) instead of fading in as one flat picture.

   --p is set by JS, so with no JS the fallbacks below (p:1) render the finished
   artwork at full extent, in colour, every layer visible. */

   ten in threes leaves a single column on a fourth row, and the alternative (four

   align-items:start keeps a short column's links at the top of its row

 * where you tap, the loop never stops); a docs masthead is furniture on a page
 * someone came to READ, so it holds still when asked, stops when scrolled past, and
 * never reacts to a click.
 *
 * The engine takes those as options rather than branching on which page it is on:
 *
 *   palette()      → {fill,label} read at BAKE time, so a theme flip can re-bake the
 *                    existing chips in place (docs) instead of resetting the field.
 *   burst          → click/tap scatters a ring of chips (landing only).
 *   pause          → run only while the band is on screen and the tab is visible.
 *   reduceMotion   → honour prefers-reduced-motion by painting ONE frame, no loop.
 *
 * Defaults reproduce the landing exactly (landing palette, no pausing, no
 * reduced-motion branch, and the loop started immediately) - this refactor moved the

/**
 * The footer sitemap: the WHOLE docs set, one column per section.
 *
 * This is a full site map, not a selection. Every page the build emits is either a
 * column HEADING (the five pathway hubs) or a link inside a column - asserted below,
 * so the footer cannot silently stop listing a page. There is no "everything else"
 * row: a catch-all is the shape a sitemap takes when it has given up being one, and
 * it hides exactly the pages nothing else links to.
 *
 * What makes that affordable is the heading. Each column's heading IS the link to
 * its pathway's main page, so the overview never costs a row of its own, and a
 * pathway too long for one readable column is split into two or three columns that
 * all point their heading at the same hub. That is where the balance comes from -
 * Builders' seventeen children are three columns of five or six rather than one
 * unreadable stack, and the same split gives Creators' ten (the "Using Lolly" set,
 * which grew by three pages when collab/search/favourites landed) a making column,
 * a finding column and a sharing column.
 *
 * The creators split IS its rail: the three columns below are exactly the rail's
 * "Make things", "Find your way" and "Share & collaborate" groups - same members,
 * same order - with only its "Creators" (hub + quickstart, both already elsewhere
 * in the footer) and "Compare" groups placed differently, as noted below. The two
 * columns that borrow a rail label ("Find your way", "Share & collaborate") hold
 * exactly the pages that label holds in the sidebar.
 *
 * Reusing a rail label over a DIFFERENT
 * set is worse than not reusing it - a reader who learned upstairs that "Find your
 * way" means search / favourites / profile then meets a fourth page under it down
 * here and has to work out which grouping is the real one.
 *
 * Builders and Trust cannot be held to that, and the reason is structural rather
 * than sloppy: a sidebar deliberately REPEATS a page across pathways (Security sits
 * in three rails; Data Transfer in two), while the footer lists every page exactly
 * once. So their columns are the rail clusters with the borrowed pages settled onto
 * one owner - cli-signing to Operators, data-transfer and about to Builders, privacy
 * and inclusive-design to Trust's second column.
 *
 * Two placements are worth stating out loud because they are footer-only groupings
 * and do NOT move the pages themselves - each page keeps its own `pathway`, its own
 * sidebar rail and its own URL:
 *   - Home sits under Quickstart. The Quickstart pathway has exactly one page, which
 *     is the heading, and a heading over an empty column reads as a bug.
 *   - "How Lolly compares" sits there too, next to Home: it is the page a reader
 *     wants BEFORE they pick a pathway, and it is the one Creators page that is not
 *     about operating the app.
 *
 * Order is the order shown. Labels reuse the SIDEBARS group labels wherever one
 * fits, so the footer and the rail name the same cluster the same way (and so the
 * string is already in every locale's site.json).

// HTML-only.

// The twin transforms (stripFrontMatter, unwrapFigureFences,
// unwrapProvenanceMarkers, stripLogoMarkers, commentStandaloneProvenanceLines,
// mdDescription) now live in @lolly-tools/docs-render - pure string ops the
// in-app docs view needs too. Imported at the top of this file.

// `node docs/build.ts --watch` rebuilds whenever a docs source changes, so the
// /info pages stay current during `npm run dev:web`. Sources are everything under
// docs/ (the markdown, faq.md, and src/*.svg) plus the repo-root README.md (the
// About page). Output goes to shells/web/public/ - outside docs/ - so a rebuild
// never re-triggers the watcher.
//
// TWO KINDS OF CHANGE, and they cannot be rebuilt the same way. A markdown or SVG
// edit is DATA: `build()` re-reads it from disk, so calling the function again is
// both correct and cheap. An edit to a .ts file in here is CODE, and every
// top-level binding this module owns - `CSS` above all, plus the page templates
// and the nav - was evaluated once when the module was imported. Calling `build()`
// after a CSS edit therefore re-emits the OLD stylesheet straight over the new
// one, silently: the file's mtime updates, the "✓" prints, and the change is gone.
// (That cost a real debugging session on 2026-07-31 - the built pages kept
// reverting and the source was plainly correct.) So a code change re-imports the
// module instead, with a cache-busting query, to get a fresh graph.
//
// The fresh copy runs its own top-level `build()` - that is the rebuild - but must
// NOT arm a second watcher, hence the env guard below. The original process stays
// the only watcher. Cost: Node keeps each imported version in its ESM cache, so a
// very long session with many builder edits accumulates a few module instances.
// That is the accepted price of never writing stale output.

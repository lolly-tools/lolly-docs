# Positioning

Where this platform fits in the wider creative-tools landscape, and where it deliberately does **not** play.

## Landscape

The shape of the gap is clear: nothing in the existing landscape gives us constraints-first, offline-capable, low-skill, internally accessible, generative output. Lolly now ships an open canvas of its own — **Layout Studio**, a direct-manipulation free canvas — but with a decisive difference from the Canva column: colours, type and assets placed on it conform to the brand globals, so even free arrangement stays constraints-first. What Lolly still is **not** is an unconstrained design suite; designers will continue to use Illustrator and Figma for bespoke work — and when that work needs to become a governed, reproducible asset, Layout Studio's [Import a design](/info/design-import.html) brings the finished Figma/Illustrator/Penpot file onto the canvas as editable, brand-conformed boxes.

## Use it for

- Rapid generation of operationalised creative assets (event tiles, badges, signatures, alerts)
- Free-form arrangement on the open canvas (Layout Studio) when the pieces — colours, type, icons, images — must stay conformed to the brand globals
- Landing a finished Figma, Illustrator, InDesign or Penpot design (Layout Studio's Import a design) so it can be edited, governed and re-rendered deterministically in every Lolly format
- One-to-many "fill in three fields, get the finished asset" flows — including bulk runs from a spreadsheet/CSV in the `/pro` batch grid (paste or import rows, one finished asset per row, download as a zip)
- Always-on, recurring branded outputs
- Things where central control of brand expression matters more than expressive flexibility

## Do not use it for

- Bespoke or flagship hero content (billboards, major videos)
- Unique campaign work that genuinely needs a designer
- Ideation that needs to escape the brand system entirely — Lolly's open canvas still conforms colours, type and assets to the brand globals, and that's the point

## What this uniquely provides

- **Wild design potential delivered safely in context.** Tools can express adventurous design ideas inside hard coded guard-rails.
- **Software-defined content automation that returns the final asset.** Input → final file. No "now save it from your design tool and post-process it."
- **Tools compose tools.** One tool can embed another tool's render and return it as part of a single finished asset, with no tool-to-tool code coupling — a primitive no open-canvas or DAM-templating product in the landscape offers.
- **Vendor neutrality.** Full feature and cost control. Open-source-able engine. Tools and assets are git-tracked content, not locked in a SaaS database.
